This flaw arises from\ninadequate input sanitization related to matching symbols, enabling adversaries\nto craft requests that bypass expected constraints and trigger unintended file\ndiscovery operations. The issue affects multiple Palo Alto Networks products\nincluding Expedition version 1, PAN-OS, Panorama, Prisma Access, and Cloud NGFW,\nthough the vulnerability is specifically rooted in Expedition’s web-accessible\ninterface. Because the exploit does not require authentication, user\ninteraction, or complex environmental conditions, it presents a broad attack\nsurface and can be executed re..."
