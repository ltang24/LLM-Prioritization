The flaw\nresides in the plugin’s handling of the 'jobwp_upload_resume' parameter, where\nuser-supplied input is incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization\nor parameterization. This oversight allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary\nSQL commands by crafting malicious HTTP requests to the exposed endpoint, which\nis accessible without authentication. The absence of access controls and the\nplugin’s public-facing nature significantly widen the attack surface, enabling\nexploitation from any internet-connected location using basic tools or automated\nscripts. The attack requires no special conditions or user interaction, making\nit hig..."
