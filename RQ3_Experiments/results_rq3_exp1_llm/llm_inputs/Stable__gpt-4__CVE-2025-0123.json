The\nvulnerability stems from inadequate enforcement of licensing checks tied to the\nDecryption Port Mirror feature, which is intended to restrict access to\nsensitive decrypted traffic unless explicitly enabled by authorized personnel.\nWhile HTTP/1.1 traffic remains unaffected, the exposure of decrypted HTTP/2\nstreams poses a significant confidentiality risk, especially in environments\nwhere sensitive data traverses internal networks. Exploitation requires\nnetwork-level access to the firewall’s manage..."
