This flaw allows an attacker to\nremotely execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable device, as the exploit can\nbe initiated over the internet without requiring physical access or prior\nauthentication, significantly widening the attack surface. The exploitation\nprocess is straightforward, requiring only the crafting of a malicious POST\nrequest to manipulate the vulnerable parameter, with no complex prerequisites or\nenvironmental conditions necessary for successful execution.
