The vulnerability stems from\ninsufficient enforcement of access controls, allowing unauthorized users to\ninvoke privileged operations without proper validation of their role or\npermissions. Technically, the flaw permits direct access to sensitive\nadministrative functions via a crafted URL, bypassing expected privilege checks\nand enabling remote actors to manipulate backend data structures. The exploit\nrequires no specialized conditions or timing constraints, and can be executed by\nsimply appending known paths to the base application URL, making it highly\naccessible and straightforward to abuse.
