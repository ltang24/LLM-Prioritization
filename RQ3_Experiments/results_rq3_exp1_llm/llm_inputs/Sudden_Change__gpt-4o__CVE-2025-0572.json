The flaw stems from insufficient sanitization of\nuser-supplied file paths, allowing authenticated remote attackers to manipulate\ninput values in a way that bypasses directory restrictions and results in\narbitrary file creation on the host system. This vulnerability is rooted in\nimproper validation logic that fails to constrain file operations to designated\ndirectories, thereby enabling crafted DCM files to redirect write operations to\nunintended locations. Exploitation requires access to the authenticated\ninterface, but no elevated privileges beyond standard user credentials are\nnecessary, and no additional user..."
