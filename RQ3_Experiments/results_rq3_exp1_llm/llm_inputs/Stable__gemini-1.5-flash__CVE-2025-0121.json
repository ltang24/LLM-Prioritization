This\nflaw allows an attacker to crash the Cortex XDR agent, potentially leading to a\ndenial of service, while simultaneously enabling malware to execute malicious\nactivities undetected by the security software. The root cause of this\nvulnerability lies in the improper handling of input data, where crafted inputs\ncan trigger the vulnerable code path without requiring elevated privileges or\nspecial environmental conditions. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability\nthrough the normal operation..."
