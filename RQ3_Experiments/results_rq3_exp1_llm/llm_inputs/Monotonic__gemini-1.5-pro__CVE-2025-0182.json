The issue arises from the use of a vulnerable version\nof the starlette package (<=0.49) via fastapi, which was patched in fastapi\nversion 0.115.3. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending multiple requests\nto the /auth/saml/callback endpoint, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption\nand eventual denial of service.. Regarding attack vector, analysis indicates\nthat The vulnerability is triggered by sending repeated requests to a specific\nendpoint exposed over HTTP, namely /auth/saml/callback. This implies that\nexploitation can occur remotely over a without requiring access or proximity.\nSince the endpoint..."
