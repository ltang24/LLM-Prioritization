The\nvulnerability stems from a design flaw in how the client-side interface caches\ntransactional input to enhance usability, inadvertently allowing data\npersistence in a location that lacks sufficient isolation from system-level\nactors. Specifically, if an adversary gains administrative control or direct\naccess to the victim’s operating system user directory, they can extract stored\nbrowser data without needing to compromise the SAP application itself. The risk\nto confidentiality is substantial, as the nature of the exposed data depends on\nthe user’s activity ..."
