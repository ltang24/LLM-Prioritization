The flaw allows\nan authenticated user with network access to the management web interface to\ndelete select files—such as certain logs and configuration data—under the\n“nobody” user context, though it does not permit deletion of core system files.\nThe underlying issue stems from improper validation of externally supplied file\npaths, enabling unauthorized manipulation of file operations via crafted input.\nThis vulnerability arises from a lack of robust controls over user-supplied\nfilenames or paths, aligning with the CWE-73 classification.
