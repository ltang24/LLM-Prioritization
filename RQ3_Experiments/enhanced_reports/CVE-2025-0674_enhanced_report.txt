CVE-2025-0674 exposes a critical authentication bypass vulnerability affecting
multiple Elber broadcast and communications devices, including the Signum
DVB-S/S2 IRD, Cleber/3 Multi-Purpose Platform, Reble610 M/ODU XPIC IP-ASI-SDH,
ESE DVB-S/S2 Satellite Receiver, and Wayber Analog/Digital Audio STL. The flaw
resides in the password management interface, where improper validation of
authentication status allows unauthenticated actors to submit crafted requests
that overwrite any user’s password, including those of administrative accounts.
This vulnerability stems from a failure to enforce access control on sensitive
endpoints, permitting direct manipulation of credential data without verifying
session legitimacy. Exploitation requires no specialized conditions or timing
constraints; an attacker simply needs network access to the exposed interface
and knowledge of the endpoint structure, which can be inferred from
documentation or reconnaissance. Once the vulnerable path is reached, the
attacker can reset credentials and gain full administrative control, enabling
unauthorized configuration changes, data exfiltration, or use of the device as a
pivot for lateral movement within the network. The risk implications are severe,
with potential compromise of confidentiality through unauthorized access to
stored data, integrity violations via unauthorized modifications, and
availability degradation if the attack is automated or repeated to exhaust
system resources. The attack vector is remote and does not require physical
proximity, and the complexity is low, making exploitation feasible for
moderately skilled adversaries. No user interaction is necessary beyond the
attacker’s own actions, and the impact remains confined to the affected
component unless the device is integrated into broader systems where privilege
escalation could propagate. Real-world scenarios include attackers targeting
broadcast infrastructure to disrupt signal integrity or hijack transmission
controls, especially in environments where Elber devices are deployed without
network segmentation or proper firewall rules. Mitigation requires immediate
firmware updates from Elber that enforce strict authentication checks on all
sensitive operations, particularly password changes. Network administrators
should also restrict access to management interfaces through segmentation, VPNs,
or access control lists, and monitor for anomalous POST requests to password
endpoints. Until patches are applied, compensating controls such as web
application firewalls or intrusion detection systems may reduce exposure. Based
on available technical details, public exploit code, and consistent behavior
across affected models, confidence in the vulnerability’s exploitability and
impact is high, warranting urgent remediation efforts across all deployments.
