A recently identified denial-of-service vulnerability, designated as
CVE-2025-0128, affects specific versions of Palo Alto Networks' PAN-OS software,
specifically versions 10.1.0 through 11.2.0, while the Cloud NGFW and Prisma
Access products are not susceptible to this issue due to proactive patching. The
vulnerability arises from improper handling of exceptional conditions within the
Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) authentication feature, allowing
an unauthenticated attacker to send specially crafted packets that can trigger
system reboots. This exploitation mechanism can lead to the firewall entering
maintenance mode after repeated attempts, effectively disrupting service
availability. The attack vector is straightforward, as the vulnerable operation
is accessible through the normal input path without requiring physical proximity
or elevated privileges, making it relatively easy for an attacker to exploit.
The complexity of the attack is low, relying solely on the ability to send
crafted data to the affected code path, with no unusual environmental
constraints. In realistic scenarios, an attacker could automate the sending of
malicious packets to a vulnerable system, causing it to reboot repeatedly and
thereby denying service to legitimate users. To mitigate this vulnerability,
organizations should ensure that they are running the latest versions of PAN-OS
and apply any available patches promptly. Additionally, monitoring network
traffic for unusual patterns that may indicate exploitation attempts could
further enhance security posture. Confidence in the assessment of this
vulnerability is high, given the detailed nature of the reported issue and the
clear guidance provided by Palo Alto Networks regarding affected products and
remediation steps.
