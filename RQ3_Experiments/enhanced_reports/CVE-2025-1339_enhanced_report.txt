A critical vulnerability has been identified in the TOTOLINK X18 router,
specifically in version 9.1.0cu.2024_B20220329, which allows for OS command
injection through the manipulation of the 'enable' argument within the
setL2tpdConfig function of a CGI script accessible via the device's web
interface. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely, significantly widening
the attack surface as it does not require physical access or proximity to the
device, making it particularly concerning for users with internet-exposed
routers. The exploitation process is straightforward, as it involves sending
crafted requests to the vulnerable CGI endpoint, which can be achieved without
any special conditions or complex security mechanisms, thus lowering the barrier
for potential attackers. Scenarios for exploitation could include an attacker
using default or weak credentials to gain access to the router's administrative
interface, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying
operating system, which could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information
such as configuration files or user credentials. Furthermore, the lack of
requirement for user interaction simplifies the attack, enabling automated
exploitation methods that could be executed at scale. To mitigate this risk,
users are advised to immediately update their devices to the latest firmware
version provided by the vendor, implement strong authentication measures, and
restrict access to the web interface from untrusted networks. Given that the
vendor has not responded to early disclosure attempts, there is a heightened
level of concern regarding the potential for widespread exploitation,
underscoring the urgency for users to take proactive steps to secure their
devices. The confidence in the assessment of this vulnerability is high,
considering the public disclosure of the exploit and the straightforward nature
of the command injection technique, which can be reliably executed by attackers
with minimal effort.
