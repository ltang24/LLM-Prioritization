CVE-2025-0035 identifies a critical vulnerability within the AMD Cloud
Manageability Service, specifically version 2.0.0.262, which stems from an
unquoted search path issue that permits local attackers to escalate privileges,
potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The root cause lies in the
improper handling of executable paths, allowing an attacker with local access to
the system to place a malicious executable in a directory that is prioritized
over the legitimate service binary during execution. This exploitation mechanism
does not require advanced technical skills, as it involves simply writing a file
to a directory included in the vulnerable search path, which can be achieved
with a standard user account that has write permissions. The attack vector
necessitates that the AMD service is running, which may occur automatically at
system startup or through user interaction, thereby introducing a dependency on
user behavior for successful exploitation. Once the attacker successfully
executes their code with elevated privileges, they can access sensitive data,
modify system files, and disrupt system operations, significantly compromising
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system.
Mitigation strategies should focus on ensuring that executable paths are
properly quoted and implementing strict access controls to prevent unauthorized
file placements in critical directories. Users are also advised to regularly
update their systems and monitor for unusual activities that may indicate
exploitation attempts. Given the nature of this vulnerability and its
exploitation requirements, confidence in the assessment of its impact is high,
particularly in environments where the AMD Cloud Manageability Service is
actively utilized.
