CVE-2025-0364 affects BigAntSoft’s BigAnt Server up to version 5.6.06 and
exposes a critical flaw that permits unauthenticated remote code execution
through a misconfigured SaaS registration pathway. The vulnerability stems from
an authentication bypass, where the default registration interface—intended for
legitimate user onboarding—can be exploited by an external actor to create an
administrative account without any prior credentials. Once elevated to
administrator, the attacker can leverage the built-in “Cloud Storage Addin” to
upload and execute arbitrary PHP scripts directly on the server, effectively
gaining full control over the system. This flaw is remotely exploitable over
standard internet protocols, requiring no physical access or insider knowledge,
and the attack sequence is straightforward, involving no timing dependencies or
environmental constraints. The absence of user interaction further amplifies the
risk, as the attacker can initiate and complete the exploit autonomously without
triggering any user-side events. The impact is systemic: by breaching the
authentication boundary and executing code with administrative privileges, the
attacker can access sensitive configuration files, user data, and internal
communications, thereby compromising confidentiality. Moreover, the ability to
alter server-side scripts and stored content undermines data integrity, while
the potential to delete files or disrupt services poses a serious threat to
availability. Real-world exploitation could involve adversaries deploying web
shells, siphoning off proprietary data, or launching persistent
denial-of-service campaigns against enterprise deployments. Organizations
relying on BigAnt Server for internal messaging or file sharing are particularly
vulnerable, especially if the SaaS registration endpoint remains exposed to the
public internet. To mitigate this risk, immediate action should be taken to
disable or restrict access to the registration interface, enforce strict
validation and authentication controls, and audit administrative account
creation workflows. Upgrading to a patched version, if available, or applying
compensating controls such as web application firewalls and intrusion detection
systems is strongly advised. Given the simplicity of the attack, the lack of
prerequisites, and the breadth of impact across confidentiality, integrity, and
availability domains, this vulnerability represents a severe security concern.
Confidence in this assessment is high, based on consistent technical indicators
and corroborated exploitation mechanics across multiple sources.
