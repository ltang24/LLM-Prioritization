CVE-2025-0451 identifies a flaw in the Extensions API of Google Chrome versions
prior to 133.0.6943.53, where improper implementation permits remote adversaries
to execute UI spoofing attacks by leveraging maliciously crafted Chrome
extensions. The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation and isolation
within the API’s rendering logic, allowing deceptive interface elements to be
presented to users under the guise of legitimate browser components.
Exploitation requires the attacker to persuade a user to perform specific
interface interactions—such as clicking or navigating—within a compromised
extension, which then triggers the spoofing behavior. The attack surface is
exposed through standard browser input channels, and no specialized access or
environmental conditions are necessary beyond the ability to deliver the
extension payload. Once installed, the extension operates with typical
user-level privileges, and the exploit can be initiated without further
authentication or elevated permissions. The risk implications are notable: while
the scope of impact remains confined to the browser’s domain, successful
exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user data,
manipulation of displayed content, and potential degradation of browser
performance through repeated invocation of resource-intensive routines.
Real-world scenarios may include phishing-style overlays that mimic login
prompts or security warnings, misleading users into divulging credentials or
executing unintended actions. Although the vulnerability does not inherently
breach system-level boundaries, its capacity to erode user trust and facilitate
secondary attacks—such as credential harvesting or session hijacking—raises
concern. Mitigation involves updating Chrome to version 133.0.6943.53 or later,
which includes revised handling of extension-rendered UI elements and stricter
enforcement of contextual boundaries. Administrators should also audit installed
extensions for anomalous behavior and consider implementing group policies that
restrict extension installation to vetted sources. Based on available technical
documentation and the nature of the exploit path, confidence in the
vulnerability’s reproducibility and impact assessment is high, though the
likelihood of widespread exploitation remains contingent on user interaction and
social engineering success.
