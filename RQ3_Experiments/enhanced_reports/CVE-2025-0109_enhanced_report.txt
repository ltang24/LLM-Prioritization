CVE-2025-0109 describes a vulnerability in specific versions of Palo Alto
Networks PAN-OS where the management web interface permits unauthenticated file
deletion under the context of the “nobody” user, exposing limited log and
configuration files to potential erasure. This flaw stems from improper
validation of externally supplied file paths, allowing adversaries to manipulate
input parameters that control file operations, consistent with the weakness
category involving external control of file names or paths. The vulnerability is
accessible remotely via standard network exposure of the management interface,
requiring no authentication or elevated privileges, which significantly lowers
the barrier to exploitation. Attackers can craft requests that reach the
vulnerable code path without needing to bypass complex environmental conditions
or rely on timing-based exploits. Once the interface is reachable, exploitation
is straightforward and does not depend on user interaction, making automated
scanning and mass targeting plausible. While the scope of impact is confined to
the local authority of the management interface and does not extend to core
system files or broader platform boundaries, the ability to delete configuration
and log data can disrupt administrative visibility, hinder forensic
investigations, and potentially degrade system availability if repeated or
chained with other flaws. Confidentiality risks are minimal unless deleted logs
contain sensitive operational metadata, but integrity and availability are more
directly affected due to the potential for unauthorized data manipulation and
service degradation. Realistic attack scenarios include adversaries scanning
exposed PAN-OS interfaces across public IP ranges, identifying vulnerable
versions, and issuing crafted deletion requests to erase audit trails or disrupt
configuration baselines. Mitigation should prioritize strict network
segmentation and access control, ensuring that the management interface is only
reachable from trusted internal segments, as outlined in Palo Alto Networks’
deployment best practices. Organizations should also consider implementing web
application firewalls or reverse proxies to inspect and sanitize incoming
requests, and apply vendor-issued patches or version upgrades as they become
available. Given the clarity of the vulnerability’s behavior, the directness of
the attack path, and the vendor’s documentation, confidence in the technical
characterization and risk assessment is high, though ongoing monitoring is
advised to detect any evolution in exploitation techniques or emergence of
chained vulnerabilities.
