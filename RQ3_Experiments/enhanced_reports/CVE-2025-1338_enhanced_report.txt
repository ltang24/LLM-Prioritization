CVE-2025-1338 identifies a critical command injection vulnerability affecting
NUUO Camera systems up to version 20250203, specifically within the print_file
function of the handle_config.php script. The flaw stems from improper handling
of user-supplied input to the 'log' parameter, which is passed unsanitized into
system-level command execution routines. This oversight enables remote attackers
to craft HTTP requests that inject arbitrary shell commands, bypassing any need
for authentication or user interaction. The attack surface is broad, as the
vulnerable endpoint is exposed over the network and reachable via standard web
protocols, allowing exploitation from virtually any location with internet
access. The simplicity of the exploit—requiring only basic manipulation of a
single parameter—combined with the absence of environmental constraints or
privilege requirements, makes this vulnerability highly accessible to threat
actors with minimal technical skill. Once exploited, attackers can execute
commands within the context of the web server, potentially accessing sensitive
configuration files, surveillance footage, or stored credentials, thereby
compromising confidentiality. Integrity is also at risk, as malicious actors
could alter system settings, inject persistent backdoors, or tamper with
recorded data. Furthermore, the ability to disrupt services by deleting critical
files or exhausting system resources poses a serious threat to availability,
potentially rendering the camera system inoperable. While the impact appears
confined to the local execution environment and does not inherently cross
security boundaries, the consequences within that domain are severe. Real-world
scenarios could include mass exploitation of publicly exposed devices for
espionage, data theft, or as footholds for lateral movement in larger network
intrusions. Given the public disclosure of the exploit and the vendor’s lack of
response, the threat landscape is exacerbated by the absence of official patches
or guidance. Organizations relying on affected NUUO Camera models should
immediately implement compensating controls, such as network-level access
restrictions, web application firewalls with command injection signatures, and
rigorous monitoring for anomalous device behavior. Until a vendor-issued fix is
available, isolating vulnerable systems from untrusted networks is imperative.
Based on the clarity of the technical details, the public availability of
exploitation methods, and the lack of mitigating factors, confidence in the
assessment is high.
