The vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-0113 affects the Palo Alto Networks
Cortex XDR Broker VM version 1.0.0, stemming from a flaw in the network
isolation mechanism that permits unauthorized access to Docker containers from
the host network utilized by the Broker VM. This vulnerability arises from
improper protection of alternate paths, allowing an attacker with access to the
same network segment as the Broker VM to directly exploit the flaw without the
need for authentication or elevated privileges. Consequently, an attacker can
read sensitive files and logs transmitted by the Cortex XDR Agent to the Cortex
XDR server, thereby compromising the confidentiality of potentially sensitive
information, such as endpoint activity and user-identifiable data. The attack
does not require any user interaction, making it particularly insidious, as it
can be executed without alerting legitimate users or relying on social
engineering tactics. The exploitation is confined to the same security boundary,
meaning that while the attacker can access data within the Docker containers,
they cannot affect the integrity or availability of the Broker VM or its
services. This limitation does not diminish the risk, as the ability to extract
sensitive information poses significant privacy and security concerns. Realistic
exploitation scenarios could involve an insider threat or an attacker gaining
access to a shared cloud infrastructure where the Broker VM is deployed, thereby
facilitating unauthorized data access. To mitigate this vulnerability,
organizations should implement strict network segmentation to isolate the Broker
VM from untrusted networks and enforce rigorous access controls to limit who can
connect to the host network. Regular updates and patches from Palo Alto Networks
should also be applied promptly to address known vulnerabilities. Given the
nature of the vulnerability and its implications, confidence in the assessment
of this threat is high, as it presents a clear risk to the confidentiality of
sensitive data within the affected environment.
