A critical vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-1800 affects the D-Link DAR-7000
product version 3.2, specifically within the HTTP POST request handler's
function for retrieving IP address details, where improper handling of the
'ethname' parameter leads to command injection. This flaw allows an attacker to
remotely execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable device, as the exploit can
be initiated over the internet without requiring physical access or prior
authentication, significantly widening the attack surface. The exploitation
process is straightforward, requiring only the crafting of a malicious POST
request to manipulate the vulnerable parameter, with no complex prerequisites or
environmental conditions necessary for successful execution. Given that the
endpoint is accessible without authentication, any unauthenticated user can
exploit this vulnerability, eliminating barriers that typically hinder such
attacks. Furthermore, the exploit does not depend on any user interaction,
allowing attackers to execute the command injection autonomously, thus enhancing
the risk of automated or mass exploitation scenarios. If successfully exploited,
this vulnerability could grant attackers control over the affected system,
potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or further network
compromise, especially since the affected product is no longer supported by the
vendor, leaving it without security updates or patches. To mitigate this risk,
organizations should immediately isolate affected devices from the network,
implement strict firewall rules to block unauthorized access, and consider
replacing unsupported hardware with updated models that receive regular security
maintenance. Given the public disclosure of this vulnerability and the
availability of exploit code, the confidence in the potential for exploitation
is high, necessitating prompt action to safeguard against possible attacks.
