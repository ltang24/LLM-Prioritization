CVE-2025-0108 describes a critical flaw in Palo Alto Networks’ PAN-OS software,
specifically affecting versions 10.1.0, 10.2.0, 11.1.0, and 11.2.0, where the
management web interface fails to enforce authentication for certain PHP
scripts, allowing unauthenticated actors with network access to bypass login
requirements and interact directly with sensitive backend functions. This
vulnerability stems from a missing authentication check on critical operations,
categorized under the common weakness of insufficient access control, and while
it does not enable remote code execution, it poses significant risks to both
data confidentiality and system integrity. The attack surface is exposed through
the standard management interface, which is typically reachable over the network
without requiring physical proximity, and exploitation involves supplying
crafted requests that are processed without triggering any unusual environmental
conditions or requiring elevated privileges. Once the interface is accessible,
an attacker can initiate the exploit autonomously, without needing user
interaction, making the threat highly actionable in real-world scenarios. For
example, a threat actor operating within the same network segment or leveraging
misconfigured firewall rules could exploit this flaw to extract sensitive
configuration data or manipulate system states, potentially undermining
administrative controls or altering security policies. The impact remains
confined to the PAN-OS component unless the invoked scripts bridge to other
subsystems, in which case the scope of compromise could extend beyond the
immediate module. Although the vulnerability does not directly affect Palo
Alto’s Cloud NGFW or Prisma Access offerings, organizations relying on affected
PAN-OS versions should urgently restrict access to the management interface
using IP whitelisting and network segmentation, as outlined in Palo Alto’s
deployment best practices. Additional hardening measures such as disabling
unused services, enforcing multi-factor authentication, and applying
vendor-issued patches upon availability are recommended to reduce exposure.
Given the straightforward nature of the exploit, the absence of mitigating
factors like required user interaction or complex preconditions, and the
potential for unauthorized data access or system manipulation, this
vulnerability presents a substantial risk profile. Our confidence in the
assessment is high, based on the clarity of the technical documentation and the
consistency of observed behavior across multiple sources, indicating that
exploitation is not only feasible but likely in environments where interface
access is insufficiently controlled.
