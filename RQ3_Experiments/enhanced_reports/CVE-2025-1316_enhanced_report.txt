The vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-1316 affects all versions of the Edimax
IC-7100 IP camera, stemming from improper handling of input within its web
interface, which allows for command injection. This flaw enables an attacker to
craft specific requests that can lead to remote code execution without the need
for authentication or prior access, significantly amplifying the risk associated
with this vulnerability. The exploitation process is straightforward, as it
requires no complex maneuvers; an attacker can send malicious input containing
shell metacharacters directly to the device’s web interface, thereby bypassing
any security mechanisms. This autonomous attack does not necessitate user
interaction, allowing the perpetrator to initiate the exploitation
independently. Once successfully executed, the attacker gains the ability to run
arbitrary commands within the context of the web server process, which can lead
to severe implications for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For
instance, they could access sensitive video feeds, modify system configurations,
or disrupt the camera's operation entirely, potentially rendering it inoperable.
Given the nature of the device and the type of data it handles, the consequences
of such exploitation could be profound, affecting not only the device itself but
also the privacy of individuals captured in its recordings. To mitigate this
risk, it is crucial for users to apply any available firmware updates from
Edimax and implement network segmentation to limit exposure to the device’s web
interface. Additionally, employing firewalls to restrict access to the camera
from untrusted networks can further reduce the likelihood of exploitation.
Overall, the confidence in the existence and exploitability of this
vulnerability is high, as it has been reported in public forums and has already
been weaponized in various malicious campaigns, underscoring the urgent need for
proactive security measures.
