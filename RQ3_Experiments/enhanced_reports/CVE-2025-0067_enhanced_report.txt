The vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-0067 affects the SAP NetWeaver
Application Server Java, specifically in the WD-RUNTIME 7.50 version, due to a
lack of proper authorization checks on service endpoints. This oversight allows
an attacker with standard user privileges to create Java Connector (JCo)
connection entries, which facilitate remote function calls to and from the
application server. The technical root cause lies in the inadequate validation
of user permissions, enabling unauthorized actions that could compromise the
application's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Exploitation can
occur through the normal input channels of the application, where an attacker
can submit crafted data to invoke the vulnerable code path without needing
physical access or special conditions. The complexity of the attack is
relatively low, as it does not require intricate timing or environmental
manipulations; rather, it relies on standard data parsing and handling
mechanisms. A realistic scenario could involve an attacker leveraging their
standard user account to create malicious JCo entries, potentially leading to
unauthorized data exposure or manipulation. While the immediate impact may be
limited, the potential for information disclosure and data integrity issues
exists, particularly if the system inadvertently returns sensitive data or
allows for unauthorized modifications. To mitigate this vulnerability,
organizations should implement stringent authorization checks and review access
controls for service endpoints, ensuring that only users with appropriate
permissions can perform sensitive operations. Regular security assessments and
updates from SAP should also be prioritized to address any emerging threats.
Given the nature of the vulnerability and the context of its exploitation, there
is a moderate level of confidence in the assessment of its implications and the
recommended remediation strategies.
