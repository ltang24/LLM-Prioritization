CVE-2025-0064 affects SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence platform,
specifically its Central Management Console in versions ENTERPRISE 430 and 2025,
where under certain system states, an administrator can exploit flawed
permission assignments to generate or retrieve a secret passphrase that enables
impersonation of any user within the environment. This vulnerability stems from
improper access control over critical authentication resources, allowing
privileged actors to bypass identity boundaries and assume roles beyond their
own. The exploit is achievable remotely through standard network access to the
console, without requiring physical proximity or user interaction, and hinges on
the attacker already possessing administrative credentials—either through prior
compromise or insider access. While the attack does not disrupt system
availability, it poses serious risks to confidentiality and integrity, as it
grants unauthorized access to sensitive business intelligence data and permits
manipulation of reports, configurations, and user actions across the platform.
The scope of impact extends beyond the initial account, enabling cross-context
privilege escalation that undermines trust in system governance and data
authenticity. Exploitation does not rely on timing anomalies or environmental
quirks, making it relatively straightforward once the attacker is authenticated
and the system is in a vulnerable configuration. Real-world scenarios could
include a malicious insider leveraging their admin role to exfiltrate
proprietary analytics or a threat actor who has breached perimeter defenses and
escalated privileges to compromise executive-level accounts. To mitigate this
issue, SAP has issued guidance and patches under Security Note 3525794, and
organizations should promptly apply these updates, audit administrative access,
and enforce strict role-based controls to prevent misuse of sensitive
authentication mechanisms. Given the clarity of the vulnerability’s behavior,
the availability of remediation, and the well-defined conditions for
exploitation, confidence in the assessment is high.
