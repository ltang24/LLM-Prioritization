CVE-2025-1015 identifies a vulnerability in Mozilla Thunderbird versions prior
to 128.7 and 135, where address book URI fields fail to properly sanitize
embedded links, allowing attackers to craft malicious contact entries that
execute unprivileged JavaScript within Thunderbird’s internal web view. The flaw
stems from inadequate input validation in fields such as “Other” under the
Instant Messaging section, enabling the injection of JavaScript URIs that are
later rendered when a user clicks the link post-import. Exploitation requires no
special privileges or access to the target system; the attacker merely needs to
distribute a malicious address book file—commonly in vCard format—via email or
other remote channels. The exploit is triggered only after the victim manually
imports the file and interacts with the embedded link, making user engagement a
critical prerequisite. The attack vector is remote and leverages standard
application functionality without requiring proximity or complex environmental
conditions. While the JavaScript payload operates within a constrained context,
it can still access and manipulate data visible in Thunderbird’s internal
browser, potentially exposing contact details or misleading users through
deceptive content. However, it cannot breach system-level boundaries or access
encrypted communications, limiting the scope of confidentiality and integrity
impact to the application’s own domain. The exploit does not appear to affect
Thunderbird’s availability or stability, as the payload executes without causing
crashes or resource exhaustion. Real-world scenarios may include phishing
campaigns where attackers entice users to import seemingly legitimate address
books, then lure them into clicking embedded links that redirect to spoofed
login pages or inject misleading data. Mitigation involves upgrading to patched
Thunderbird versions where input sanitization has been enforced for address book
fields, thereby neutralizing the injection vector. Organizations should also
implement user awareness training to reduce susceptibility to social engineering
tactics and consider disabling automatic rendering of URI fields in imported
contacts. Based on the clarity of the exploit path, the simplicity of the
attack, and the confined but tangible impact on user data and trust, this
assessment is made with high confidence.
