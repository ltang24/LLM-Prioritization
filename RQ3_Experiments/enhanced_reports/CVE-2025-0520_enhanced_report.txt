CVE-2025-0520 identifies a critical vulnerability in ShowDoc, specifically
versions prior to 2.8.7, stemming from inadequate validation of file extensions
during file uploads, which permits the execution of arbitrary PHP code and
consequently leads to remote code execution. This flaw, categorized under
unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities, allows attackers to exploit the system
remotely via the web interface, where they can upload a crafted PHP file without
needing physical access to the server. The exploitation process is
straightforward, as it relies on the application's failure to enforce proper
file extension checks, allowing an attacker to bypass restrictions by either
using a permitted extension or manipulating the upload process. While the
attacker must have basic user privileges to access the file upload
functionality, the attack does not require additional user interaction, enabling
the attacker to execute the malicious file directly once uploaded. The
implications of this vulnerability extend beyond the immediate application, as
successful exploitation can grant the attacker access to sensitive data,
including configuration files and user credentials, while also allowing for
potential modifications to application logic and data integrity. Furthermore,
the attacker could disrupt service availability by executing scripts that
consume excessive resources or delete critical files, thereby impacting the
overall functionality of the server. To mitigate this risk, it is essential for
organizations to implement strict file type validation, employ robust
authentication mechanisms, and monitor file uploads closely to detect and
prevent unauthorized actions. Given the nature of the vulnerability and the
potential for significant impact, confidence in the assessment of this threat is
high, necessitating immediate attention from affected users to safeguard their
systems against exploitation.
