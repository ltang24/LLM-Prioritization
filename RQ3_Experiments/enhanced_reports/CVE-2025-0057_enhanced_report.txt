CVE-2025-0057 identifies a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability within the
SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA User Admin Application, specifically affecting versions
ENGINEAPI 7.50, SERVERCORE 7.50, and UMEADMIN 7.50. This vulnerability arises
from an unrestricted file upload feature that permits an attacker, masquerading
as an administrator, to upload a photo containing malicious JavaScript code.
When a victim subsequently accesses the compromised component, the embedded
script executes within the context of the victim's web browser, allowing the
attacker to read and manipulate sensitive information accessible through that
session. The exploitation of this vulnerability does not necessitate complex
conditions; it merely requires the attacker to gain administrative privileges to
upload the malicious file, which can be achieved through methods such as
credential theft or privilege escalation. The attack vector is entirely
web-based, relying on the victim's interaction with the compromised application,
which means that user engagement is crucial for the attack to succeed. Once the
victim visits the affected component, the malicious JavaScript executes
automatically, enabling the attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data such as
session tokens or user credentials, and potentially alter the victim's browser
session to perform unauthorized actions. While the vulnerability does not
directly impact the application's availability, the potential for data
manipulation and unauthorized transactions poses significant risks to the
integrity and confidentiality of the information processed within the
application. To mitigate this vulnerability, organizations should enforce strict
input validation, implement robust authentication mechanisms to limit
administrative access, and regularly audit user permissions. Additionally,
security awareness training for users can help reduce the likelihood of falling
victim to such attacks. Given the requirement for administrative access and user
interaction, the confidence in the exploitability of this vulnerability is
moderate, as it necessitates a combination of successful privilege acquisition
and user engagement to achieve its malicious objectives.
