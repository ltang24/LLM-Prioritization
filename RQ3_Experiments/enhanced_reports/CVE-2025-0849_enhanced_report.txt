CVE-2025-0849 identifies a critical flaw in CampCodes School Management Software
version 1.0, specifically within the Staff Handler component exposed via the
/edit-staff/ endpoint, where improper authorization controls allow privilege
escalation and unauthorized data manipulation. The vulnerability stems from
insufficient validation of user roles and access rights, enabling actors with
basic authenticated access—such as a teacher role—to perform operations reserved
for higher-privileged accounts like super administrators. This lapse in access
control logic permits malicious users to craft requests that bypass intended
restrictions, exploiting an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) pattern to
alter sensitive staff records or retrieve confidential administrative data. The
attack surface is fully remote, requiring no physical proximity or specialized
conditions beyond access to the application’s interface, and the exploitation
process is straightforward, relying on predictable input manipulation without
timing constraints or complex environmental dependencies. Once authenticated, an
attacker can initiate the exploit autonomously without needing further user
interaction, making the threat highly viable in real-world scenarios such as
insider misuse or credential compromise. The impact is multifaceted:
confidentiality is undermined through exposure of privileged data, integrity is
compromised by unauthorized updates to staff roles and permissions, and
availability may be degraded if the endpoint is abused repeatedly to stress
backend resources. Given the public disclosure of exploit details and the
simplicity of execution, the risk profile is elevated, especially for
institutions relying on default configurations or lacking compensating controls.
Mitigation requires immediate implementation of strict role-based access checks
on the /edit-staff/ function, coupled with audit logging to detect anomalous
privilege changes and patching the vulnerable logic to enforce proper
authorization boundaries. Organizations should also consider revoking exposed
credentials and conducting a retrospective review of staff role assignments to
identify unauthorized changes. Based on the clarity of technical indicators, the
reproducibility of the exploit, and corroborating public documentation,
confidence in the assessment is high, and urgent remediation is advised to
prevent compromise of administrative integrity and data confidentiality within
affected deployments.
