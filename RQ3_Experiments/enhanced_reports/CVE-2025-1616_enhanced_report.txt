CVE-2025-1616 describes a critical vulnerability in FiberHome’s AN5506-01A ONU
GPON device, specifically affecting firmware version RP2511 through its
Diagnosis component, where improper handling of the “Destination Address”
parameter enables remote attackers to inject arbitrary operating system
commands. The flaw stems from insufficient input sanitization within the
component’s request parsing logic, allowing crafted inputs to traverse unchecked
into system-level execution contexts. This vulnerability is remotely exploitable
without requiring physical access or user interaction, significantly expanding
the threat landscape, especially for devices exposed to public networks. The
attack requires no specialized timing or environmental conditions and can be
executed with minimal effort, particularly given the public availability of
exploit code. Depending on the deployment configuration, exploitation may or may
not require prior authentication; however, in many cases, the vulnerable
interface appears reachable without credentials, enabling unauthenticated
compromise. Once exploited, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the
privileges of the underlying process, potentially accessing sensitive
configuration files, altering system behavior, or degrading service availability
through resource exhaustion or destructive operations. Real-world scenarios
include adversaries leveraging this flaw to pivot within ISP-managed
infrastructure, disrupt customer connectivity, or establish persistent footholds
for broader campaigns. The scope of impact may remain confined to the device
itself unless privilege escalation or lateral movement is achieved through
chained exploits or misconfigured environments. Given the potential for data
exfiltration, unauthorized modifications, and service disruption, the risk
profile is substantial. Mitigation is complicated by the vendor’s lack of
response and absence of official patches, leaving network operators reliant on
compensating controls such as isolating vulnerable devices from untrusted
networks, implementing strict firewall rules, and monitoring for anomalous
command execution patterns. Until a vendor-issued fix is available, proactive
segmentation and intrusion detection remain the most viable defenses. Confidence
in this assessment is high due to the clarity of the exploit mechanism,
corroborated public disclosures, and the absence of mitigating factors that
would otherwise reduce feasibility or impact.
