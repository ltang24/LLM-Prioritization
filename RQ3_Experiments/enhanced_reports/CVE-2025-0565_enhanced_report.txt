A critical vulnerability has been identified in ZZCMS 2023, specifically within
the /index.php file, where improper handling of the 'id' parameter leads to SQL
injection. This flaw allows remote attackers to exploit the application without
requiring authentication, as the vulnerable functionality is accessible to
unauthenticated users. The exploitation mechanism involves sending crafted HTTP
requests that manipulate the 'id' parameter, making it straightforward for
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. The attack
complexity is low, as publicly available exploits facilitate the execution of
this vulnerability without the need for specialized conditions or advanced
technical skills. Given the nature of SQL injection, attackers could extract
sensitive data from the database, including user credentials and personal
information, thereby posing significant risks to confidentiality. Realistic
exploitation scenarios could involve an attacker targeting a public-facing ZZCMS
installation, sending crafted requests to retrieve unauthorized data, or even
modifying database entries, which could lead to further compromise of the
application. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential for administrators
to implement input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
attacks. Additionally, regular updates and patches should be applied to the
ZZCMS platform to address known vulnerabilities. Given the public disclosure of
this exploit and its ease of execution, there is a high level of confidence in
the potential for widespread exploitation if timely remediation measures are not
taken.
