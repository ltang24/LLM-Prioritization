CVE-2025-0061 identifies a critical flaw in SAP BusinessObjects Business
Intelligence Platform, specifically affecting versions ENTERPRISE 420, 430, and
2025, where an unauthenticated actor can hijack active sessions remotely without
requiring user involvement. The vulnerability stems from improper exposure of
sensitive system information, allowing crafted network inputs to traverse
standard application pathways and reach internal logic that fails to adequately
restrict or sanitize session-related data. This lapse enables adversaries to
intercept or manipulate session tokens, granting them unauthorized access to the
full scope of application data and functionality. The risk profile is severe,
given the absence of authentication barriers and the attacker’s ability to
exploit the flaw over a network interface without needing elevated privileges or
complex environmental conditions. The exploitation process is straightforward,
relying on predictable data flows and typical parsing behavior, which lowers the
technical threshold for execution and increases the likelihood of real-world
abuse. Once access is gained, the attacker can view confidential reports, alter
business intelligence configurations, and potentially disrupt operational
workflows by injecting malicious content or corrupting stored datasets. In
enterprise deployments, this could translate to compromised financial
dashboards, manipulated analytics outputs, or unauthorized exposure of strategic
planning documents. The vulnerability’s impact is confined to the application’s
domain unless integrated systems or backend services are indirectly affected
through shared session contexts or data propagation. To mitigate this threat,
SAP has issued security guidance and patches under advisory note 3474398, which
should be applied immediately to all affected instances. Administrators are
urged to audit session management mechanisms, enforce stricter token validation,
and monitor for anomalous access patterns indicative of hijacking attempts.
Given the clarity of the exploit path, the lack of mitigating controls in
default configurations, and the broad scope of potential damage, our confidence
in the severity and exploitability of this vulnerability is high.
