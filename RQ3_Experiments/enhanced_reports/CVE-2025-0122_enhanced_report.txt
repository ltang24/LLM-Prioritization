CVE-2025-0122 describes a denial-of-service vulnerability affecting Palo Alto
Networks Prisma SD-WAN ION devices across versions 6.1.0 through 6.5.0, where an
attacker situated within the same network segment can exploit the device’s
packet handling logic by transmitting a flood of specially crafted packets. The
flaw stems from inadequate resource management, specifically the absence of
throttling mechanisms during packet allocation and processing, which allows the
device’s internal buffers and computational resources to be overwhelmed. This
condition arises without requiring authentication, as the vulnerable code path
is exposed through standard network interfaces, making it accessible to any
actor with adjacent network access. The exploit does not demand complex timing
or environmental conditions; rather, it leverages predictable behavior in how
the device parses and processes incoming traffic. Once the crafted packet stream
reaches the target, the device’s throughput degrades rapidly, potentially
leading to a full service outage. While the scope of impact is confined to the
affected device itself, repeated exploitation could disrupt broader network
operations if the ION device serves as a critical routing or optimization node.
There is no indication of data leakage or unauthorized modification of stored
information, suggesting that confidentiality and integrity risks are minimal;
however, the availability impact is significant due to the potential for
sustained service disruption. A realistic attack scenario involves a malicious
actor within a branch office or data center segment launching a packet storm
against the ION device, either manually or via a scripted tool, to degrade WAN
performance or force a reboot. Mitigation requires upgrading to a patched
firmware version once available, and in the interim, network administrators
should implement ingress filtering and rate-limiting controls to reduce
exposure. Segmenting the network to isolate SD-WAN devices from untrusted hosts
can further reduce risk. Given the clarity of the vulnerability’s behavior, the
straightforward nature of the attack vector, and the absence of mitigating
conditions, confidence in the assessment is high.
