CVE-2025-0001 identifies a critical vulnerability in Abacus ERP versions prior
to 2024.210.16036, 2023.205.15833, and 2022.105.15542, characterized by an
authenticated arbitrary file read flaw stemming from absolute path traversal
issues. This vulnerability allows attackers, who must possess valid credentials,
to exploit a compromised API endpoint by crafting specific URLs that can access
sensitive files, including the JSON Web Token (JWT) signing key. The
exploitation process, while requiring some knowledge of the file structure and
API behavior, does not necessitate elevated privileges beyond basic
authentication, thereby broadening the potential attack surface to any
authenticated user. The implications of this vulnerability are severe, as
successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data,
including the ability to forge tokens that impersonate other users, thereby
undermining both confidentiality and integrity across the application. Attackers
could leverage this capability to manipulate data, execute unauthorized
transactions, or access private information belonging to other users,
significantly increasing the risk of data breaches. Although the attack does not
directly impact system availability, the potential for misuse of forged tokens
could lead to disruptive actions that affect service stability. To mitigate this
vulnerability, organizations are advised to upgrade to the latest versions of
Abacus ERP and implement strict access controls, ensuring that only necessary
permissions are granted to users. Regular audits of user activity and API access
logs can further help in identifying and responding to suspicious behavior.
Confidence in the assessment of this vulnerability is high, given the clear
exploitation pathways and the critical nature of the data involved, emphasizing
the need for immediate attention from affected organizations to safeguard their
systems and user information.
