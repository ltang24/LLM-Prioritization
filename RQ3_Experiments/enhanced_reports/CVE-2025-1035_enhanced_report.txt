CVE-2025-1035 describes a path traversal vulnerability in Komtera Technologies’
KLog Server versions prior to 3.1.1, where insufficient input validation allows
remote attackers to manipulate web-based parameters and access files outside the
intended directory structure. The flaw stems from improper handling of
user-supplied input in HTTP requests, specifically the failure to sanitize
directory traversal sequences such as "../", which are processed by the server’s
file system calls without restriction. This oversight enables adversaries to
bypass directory constraints and retrieve arbitrary files that reside on the
host system, including sensitive configuration data and potentially system-level
files like password hashes or SSH keys, depending on file permissions. The
vulnerability is exposed through the server’s web interface and can be exploited
remotely without requiring authentication or user interaction, making it
accessible to any external actor with basic knowledge of HTTP request crafting.
The attack requires no specialized tools or elevated privileges and can be
executed using standard utilities like curl or a browser, with minimal effort
and no reliance on timing conditions or environmental factors. The impact is
primarily confined to the KLog Server application itself, with no evidence
suggesting lateral movement or compromise of other system components, although
the unauthorized access to confidential data poses a significant risk to
operational security. While the exploit does not inherently allow data
modification, misconfigured deployments with overly permissive write access
could theoretically enable tampering or deletion, though such scenarios are
considered atypical. Service availability remains unaffected under normal
conditions, as the exploit does not induce resource exhaustion or
denial-of-service behavior. Real-world exploitation could involve reconnaissance
by threat actors seeking to harvest credentials or internal configurations for
further intrusion, or opportunistic attacks targeting publicly exposed instances
of the vulnerable server. To mitigate the risk, organizations should upgrade to
version 3.1.1 or later, which addresses the input validation flaw, and
additionally enforce strict access controls on file system permissions to limit
exposure. Web-facing components should be monitored for anomalous request
patterns indicative of traversal attempts, and where feasible, application-layer
firewalls should be configured to block suspicious input sequences. Based on the
simplicity of exploitation, the lack of authentication barriers, and the
potential for sensitive data exposure, this vulnerability warrants serious
attention, and the confidence in the assessment is high given the clarity of the
technical indicators and the consistency of observed behavior across reference
sources.
