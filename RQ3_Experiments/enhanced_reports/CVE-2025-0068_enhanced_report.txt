CVE-2025-0068 identifies a significant vulnerability within the SAP NetWeaver
Application Server ABAP, specifically affecting multiple versions of the
SAP_BASIS framework, including 700 through 758. The core issue arises from the
absence of necessary authorization checks in an outdated functionality, allowing
an authenticated attacker to access restricted information without appropriate
permissions. Exploitation of this flaw can occur through standard interfaces,
such as Remote Function Calls, which means that once an attacker has valid
credentials, they can leverage this vulnerability remotely without needing
physical access to the system. The complexity of the attack is relatively low,
as it does not require any special conditions or intricate maneuvers; the
attacker merely needs to invoke the vulnerable functionality using typical input
methods available within the application. Given that the exploitation is
entirely autonomous, it does not necessitate any interaction from other users,
allowing the attacker to operate freely once authenticated. The impact of this
vulnerability is primarily on confidentiality, as it facilitates unauthorized
access to potentially sensitive data, including business information and user
details, while leaving the integrity and availability of the system intact. The
scope of the vulnerability remains confined to the affected SAP NetWeaver
instance, with no indications of cross-component effects or broader system
compromise. To mitigate this risk, organizations should promptly apply the
relevant security patches provided by SAP and conduct a thorough review of user
permissions to ensure that access controls are appropriately enforced. Given the
nature of the vulnerability and its implications, there is a high level of
confidence in the assessment of its potential impact and the necessity for
immediate remediation actions.
