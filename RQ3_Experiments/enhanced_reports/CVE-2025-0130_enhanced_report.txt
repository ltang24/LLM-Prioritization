CVE-2025-0130 describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in specific versions
of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software, notably those with the web proxy feature
enabled, including versions 10.1.0 through 11.2.0, while excluding Cloud NGFW
and Prisma Access. The flaw stems from an inadequate exception handling
mechanism—specifically, the absence of a safeguard against anomalous conditions
triggered by malformed network traffic. An unauthenticated attacker can remotely
exploit this weakness by sending a carefully timed and formatted burst of
malicious packets to the firewall’s web proxy interface, causing the device to
become unresponsive and ultimately reboot. If the attack is repeated
successfully, the firewall may enter maintenance mode, requiring manual
intervention to restore functionality. This vulnerability is particularly
concerning due to its remote exploitability without any need for user
interaction or credentials, allowing threat actors to target exposed systems
over routable interfaces such as the internet or internal segments. However,
exploitation is not entirely trivial; it demands that the target system be
configured with the web proxy feature, which is license-dependent, and that the
attacker craft packets in a way that precisely triggers the exception
flaw—raising the bar for successful execution. The impact is confined to the
affected firewall itself, with no evidence of data exposure, configuration
tampering, or lateral movement, but the disruption to availability is severe, as
it undermines the firewall’s core role in traffic inspection and policy
enforcement. Real-world scenarios could include targeted denial-of-service
campaigns against perimeter defenses, potentially timed to coincide with broader
intrusions or used to degrade incident response capabilities. Organizations
relying on vulnerable PAN-OS versions should immediately assess whether the web
proxy feature is active and, if so, apply vendor-issued patches or disable the
feature until remediation is complete. Network segmentation and rate-limiting
may offer partial mitigation, but they do not eliminate the underlying flaw.
Given the clarity of the technical root cause, the reproducibility of the attack
under specific conditions, and the vendor’s confirmation, confidence in the
vulnerability’s validity and impact assessment is high.
