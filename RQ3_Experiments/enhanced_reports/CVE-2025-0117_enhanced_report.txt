CVE-2025-0117 identifies a privilege escalation flaw in Palo Alto Networks’
GlobalProtect App for Windows, affecting versions 6.0.0 through 6.3.0 and
potentially all prior releases on the platform, while other operating systems
and the UWP variant remain unaffected. The vulnerability stems from a flawed
security decision-making process that relies on input which is not properly
validated or trusted, allowing a locally authenticated user with standard
privileges to manipulate the application’s logic and elevate their access to the
highest system authority. This escalation is achieved without requiring any
interaction from other users and does not depend on unusual system
configurations or environmental conditions, making the exploit path
straightforward and consistently viable across vulnerable deployments. The
attacker must already possess a valid user account on the target Windows
machine, which narrows the exposure surface to internal or post-compromise
scenarios, but the lack of need for elevated privileges or complex setup
significantly lowers the barrier to exploitation. Once triggered, the
vulnerability enables the attacker to breach the system’s security boundaries,
gaining unrestricted access to sensitive data, modifying critical system
components, and potentially disrupting availability through malicious actions
such as disabling security controls or corrupting essential files. Real-world
exploitation could manifest in insider threat scenarios, lateral movement within
compromised enterprise environments, or persistence mechanisms deployed by
malware operators seeking long-term control. Organizations relying on affected
versions of GlobalProtect for endpoint security should prioritize remediation by
upgrading to patched releases as soon as they become available, and in the
interim, enforce strict user access controls, monitor for anomalous privilege
changes, and consider endpoint detection solutions capable of flagging
unauthorized escalation attempts. Given the clarity of the vulnerability’s
mechanism, the consistency of its exploitability across affected versions, and
the severity of its potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and
availability, the assessment of risk is high with strong confidence in the
technical validity of the threat.
