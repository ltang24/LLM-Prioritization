CVE-2025-0125 identifies a critical vulnerability within the management web
interface of Palo Alto Networks' PAN-OS software, specifically affecting
versions 10.1.0 through 11.2.0, while leaving Cloud NGFW and Prisma Access
instances unaffected. This flaw arises from improper input neutralization,
allowing an authenticated administrator to exploit the system by impersonating
another legitimate administrator. The exploitation requires network access to
the management interface, which can be achieved through standard input methods
without the need for specialized proximity or complex attack vectors. The
attacker must possess a valid account with ordinary permissions, enabling them
to manipulate the vulnerable input flow at will, thus posing a significant risk
of unauthorized data disclosure and potential data integrity breaches. Given
that the vulnerability resides within the component's operational scope,
successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
information or the ability to alter configurations, thereby compromising the
overall security posture of the affected system. Furthermore, repeated
exploitation attempts may result in service degradation or outages due to
resource exhaustion. To mitigate this risk, organizations are strongly advised
to restrict access to the management web interface solely to trusted internal IP
addresses, in line with Palo Alto Networks' deployment guidelines, and to ensure
that all software is updated to the latest versions that address this
vulnerability. The confidence in the assessment of this vulnerability is
bolstered by the clarity of the exploitation mechanism and the straightforward
nature of the required access, underscoring the urgency for organizations to
implement recommended security measures promptly.
