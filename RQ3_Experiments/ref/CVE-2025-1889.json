      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by distributing a malicious PyTorch model file that includes a non-standard pickle file extension. Since these models are commonly shared via public repositories or internal package managers, an attacker does not need access or proximity to the target system. The attack leverages the fact that picklescan fails to inspect embedded files with non-standard extensions, allowing malicious payloads to bypass security checks during model loading. This makes the attack feasible over channels such as HTTP or Git-based distribution systems.",

      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploitation requires crafting a PyTorch model archive that includes a secondary pickle file with a malicious payload and modifying the main pickle file to reference it via the pickle_file parameter. While this requires knowledge of PyTorch internals and how torch.load() handles embedded files, it does not involve unpredictable conditions or environmental dependencies. The attacker can reliably reproduce the exploit across systems that use vulnerable versions of picklescan, making the complexity relatively despite the need for some technical familiarity.",

        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need elevated privileges on the target system to execute the exploit. The malicious model can be introduced into the supply chain and consumed by users with standard access rights. The vulnerability lies in the scanning tool’s failure to inspect non-standard extensions, not in any privileged operation. Therefore, any user who loads the compromised model using torch.load() is susceptible, regardless of their permission level, as long as picklescan is used for validation beforehand.",

This means the user must perform an action—such as executing a script or running a model inference—that initiates the deserialization process. The vulnerability does not execute autonomously; it depends on user behavior to activate the payload. Thus, user interaction is a necessary component for the attack to succeed, even if the user is unaware of the underlying risk.",

        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability affects the scanning tool’s ability to detect malicious content, but the actual impact occurs within the context of the application that loads the model. The malicious pickle file, once deserialized, can execute arbitrary code, potentially altering the behavior of the host application. However, the flaw itself does not cause a change in security boundaries between different components or systems. The compromised model operates within the same trust domain as the application using it, so the scope remains confined to that environment.",

However, this impact is not guaranteed and depends on the specific payload embedded by the attacker. The vulnerability enables arbitrary code execution, which opens the door to confidentiality breaches, but the scanning bypass itself does not directly expose sensitive information.

The attacker could modify files, alter model behavior, or inject backdoors into the application.
