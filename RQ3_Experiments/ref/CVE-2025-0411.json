      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability requires the user to open a malicious archive file or visit a compromised webpage, which implies that the attack is initiated through interaction with a file or content already present on the system. This suggests that the attacker must rely on the user executing or interacting with the payload locally, rather than exploiting a remote service or -facing component. The flaw is triggered during file extraction, indicating the attack occurs within the environment of the application rather than across a boundary.",

        }
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploitation of this vulnerability depends on crafting a specific archive that bypasses the Mark-of-the-Web propagation mechanism. While the flaw itself is deterministic once the archive is crafted correctly, the attacker must ensure the archive is formatted in a way that 7-Zip fails to apply the expected security metadata. This requires knowledge of the application's internal handling of metadata and archive structures, which adds complexity. However, once the crafted archive is prepared, the exploitation path is straightforward if the user interacts with it.",

      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows code execution in the context of the current user without requiring any elevated privileges. The attacker does not need to authenticate or gain access to privileged accounts to exploit the flaw. The execution occurs as the user who opens the archive, meaning the attacker’s success is not contingent on prior access to the system or administrative rights. This makes the vulnerability accessible to attackers targeting standard user accounts.",

        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The flaw explicitly requires the user to either open a malicious archive or visit a webpage that triggers the vulnerability. Without this interaction, the crafted archive remains inert and cannot be exploited. This dependency on user behavior introduces a barrier to exploitation, as the attacker must convince the target to perform an action that initiates the vulnerable process. Social engineering or deception is likely necessary to achieve this interaction.",

There is no indication that the flaw allows the attacker to escape the boundaries of the affected application or escalate privileges beyond the user’s environment. The impact remains confined to the user’s session and does not affect other components or users on the system, suggesting that the security boundaries of the system are not breached.",

This includes sensitive files, stored credentials, and potentially resources reachable by the user. The attacker can read or exfiltrate information without restriction within the user’s scope, leading to a significant compromise of confidentiality if the user has access to valuable or sensitive data.",

This includes tampering with application behavior, injecting malicious content, or altering system settings within the user’s profile. The attacker can manipulate data to serve their objectives, which could include installing backdoors, modifying documents, or corrupting user-owned resources, resulting in a substantial impact on data integrity.",

This could involve deleting files, installing ransomware, or initiating processes that consume system resources. Although the impact is limited to the user’s environment, the attacker has the capability to render applications unusable or deny access to data, thereby affecting the availability of services and resources for the user.",
