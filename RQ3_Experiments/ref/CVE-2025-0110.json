      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is exploitable through the PAN-OS management web interface, which is typically accessed over a . This means the attacker must be able to send gNMI requests remotely, assuming they have access to the management interface. Although Palo Alto Networks recommends restricting access to trusted internal IPs, the default configuration may expose the interface to broader access, especially in less secure deployments. Therefore, the attack does not require proximity or access, and can be initiated over a connection.",

        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not appear to require any special conditions or environmental setup beyond having access to the management interface and the ability to send gNMI requests. There are no indications of race conditions, timing dependencies, or other unpredictable factors that would complicate exploitation. The attacker simply needs to craft and send malicious gNMI requests to trigger command injection, making the attack straightforward once access is obtained.",

This implies a level of access, as administrative privileges are typically reserved for trusted users. The vulnerability does not allow privilege escalation from a lower-level account; instead, it requires the attacker to already possess significant control over the system.
