      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by submitting malicious input through publicly accessible parameters in the WordPress plugin, specifically the 'from' and 'subject' fields. Since the plugin fails to sanitize and escape these inputs properly, attackers do not need access or proximity to the target system. The attack can be carried out over the internet, making it feasible for a wide range of threat actors to target vulnerable sites without any specialized infrastructure or access beyond standard web connectivity.",

      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation process is straightforward and does not require any special conditions or circumvention of security mechanisms. The attacker simply needs to craft a payload containing malicious JavaScript and submit it through the vulnerable parameters. There are no dependencies on race conditions, timing issues, or environmental factors that would complicate the attack. The plugin’s failure to sanitize input means the payload is reliably stored and executed, making the attack highly repeatable and predictable across affected versions.",

      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be triggered by unauthenticated users, meaning no login or elevated permissions are necessary to inject the malicious script. This significantly lowers the barrier to exploitation, as any external actor can submit the payload without needing to compromise credentials or gain access to privileged accounts. The plugin’s exposure of these parameters to unauthenticated users makes it particularly susceptible to automated attacks and broad exploitation campaigns.",

        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "For the malicious script to execute, a legitimate user must visit a page where the payload has been stored. This means the attacker cannot achieve their objective without some form of user engagement. The interaction is passive—users do not need to click or perform any action beyond loading the affected page—but it is still a necessary condition for the exploit to succeed. This reliance on user behavior introduces a dependency that slightly mitigates the immediacy of the threat.",

This can lead to impacts beyond the plugin itself, such as compromising user sessions, redirecting users, or manipulating content across the broader WordPress site. Because the malicious code runs in the user’s browser and can interact with other components of the site, the effects are not confined to the plugin alone and may influence other parts of the application or user experience.",

      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "Once the malicious script executes in the victim’s browser, it can access sensitive information such as authentication cookies, session tokens, or personal data displayed on the page. This data can then be exfiltrated to an external server controlled by the attacker. Although the plugin itself does not store confidential data, the script’s ability to interact with the broader site context means that user-specific information is at risk, especially if the user is logged into an administrative or privileged account.",

      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The attacker’s script can modify the content displayed to users, inject misleading information, or alter form submissions. This undermines the trustworthiness of the site and can lead to unauthorized changes in user data or site behavior. For example, the script could spoof messages, redirect users to phishing pages, or tamper with displayed content. These actions compromise the integrity of the site’s output and can have reputational or operational consequences for site administrators and users alike.",

For instance, a script could initiate resource-intensive operations or trigger denial-of-service conditions in the client environment. However, these outcomes are not inherent to the vulnerability itself and depend on the attacker’s intent.
