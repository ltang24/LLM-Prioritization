        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is triggered by rendering a crafted HTML page, which implies that exploitation occurs through web content delivered remotely. Since browsers routinely process untrusted input from the internet, the attacker does not need access or proximity to the target. The flaw resides in Skia, a graphics library used by Chrome, and is activated during normal webpage rendering. This means the attack can be executed over a connection, such as through a malicious website or embedded content in an email, making it highly scalable and accessible to remote attackers.",

      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Successfully exploiting a use-after-free vulnerability in a graphics library like Skia typically requires precise timing and memory manipulation. Attackers often need to perform heap spraying or similar techniques to control memory layout and ensure that freed memory is reused in a predictable way. However, the existence of public proof-of-concept code and the fact that the vulnerability is triggered via crafted HTML and JavaScript suggests that the exploitation process is repeatable and does not rely on unpredictable environmental factors. While technical skill is , the conditions for exploitation are stable once understood.",

        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerability occurs during the rendering of web content and is triggered by visiting a malicious HTML page. This implies that the attacker does not need any special access rights or credentials on the target system. The browser processes the content in its default context, and no elevated permissions are to initiate the exploit. The attacker operates entirely from outside the system, relying on the browser's normal behavior to execute the malicious input. Therefore, the exploit can be carried out without any prior access to the victim's machine or browser settings.",

This could involve clicking a link, opening an email, or visiting a compromised website. Although the interaction is minimal and passive—such as simply viewing a page—it is still a prerequisite for triggering the vulnerability. The browser does not autonomously fetch and render arbitrary content without user initiation, so the attacker depends on the user to perform an action that leads to the vulnerable code being executed.",

This type of flaw can potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the browser process. If successful, the attacker may gain control over the browser's execution flow, which could affect other components or processes depending on sandboxing and privilege separation.

If the attacker gains control over memory allocation, they may be able to read sensitive data stored in the browser's process space, such as cookies, session tokens, or user credentials. Although the vulnerability does not directly expose data, the ability to manipulate memory structures opens the door to information disclosure. The extent of this impact depends on the attacker's ability to control execution and extract meaningful data from the corrupted memory region.",

This could result in unauthorized modification of browser behavior, such as altering displayed content, injecting scripts, or tampering with user sessions. The vulnerability allows manipulation of memory structures, which can compromise the integrity of the browser's operations.

In this case, the browser may become unresponsive or terminate unexpectedly when rendering malicious content. This disrupts the user's ability to access web services and can result in loss of unsaved data or interrupted sessions. While the primary goal of exploitation may be code execution, even failed attempts can degrade service availability.
