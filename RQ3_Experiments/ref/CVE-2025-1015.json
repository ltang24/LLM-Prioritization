For example, it could potentially read contact details or session data if exposed in the same context. However, there is no indication that it can access encrypted emails, system files, or external resources. The impact on confidentiality is limited to what is accessible within the rendered page, which may include some user data but not critical system-level secrets.\",\n  \n  \"Integrity_Impact_Reasoning\": \"The vulnerability allows execution of JavaScript, which could manipulate the content displayed within Thunderbird’s internal browser view. This might include altering contact information, injecting misleading data, or redirecting users to phishing pages. However, the script runs without elevated privileges and cannot modify Thunderbird’s core configuration or system files. The integrity impact is therefore constrained to the user interface and potentially misleading content, rather than persistent or system-wide data corruption.\",\n  \n  \"Availability_Impact_Reasoning\": \"There is no evidence that the exploit causes Thunderbird to crash, hang, or become unusable. The JavaScript payload runs in an unprivileged context and does not appear to affect the application's stability or resource consumption. While it may lead to deceptive behavior or phishing, it does not degrade the availability of the Thunderbird application itself. The user can continue using the software normally after the exploit is triggered, suggesting minimal impact on service continuity.\"\n}\n```",
