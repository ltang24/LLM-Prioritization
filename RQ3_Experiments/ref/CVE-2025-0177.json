        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the internet by accessing the WordPress site’s registration functionality. No access or internal presence is . An attacker simply needs to reach the registration endpoint exposed by the plugin, which is typically publicly accessible on most WordPress installations. This makes the attack feasible from any location with connectivity, increasing the exposure and potential for exploitation. The lack of restrictions on registration endpoints further simplifies remote access for attackers.",

The attacker only needs to submit a registration request and specify an elevated role, such as administrator. There are no additional steps like bypassing security mechanisms, solving CAPTCHAs, or manipulating timing. The plugin’s failure to validate or restrict role assignment during registration means the attacker can reliably reproduce the exploit without needing to adapt to environmental factors or system configurations.",

This level of control allows tampering with the integrity of the website, including defacing pages, injecting malicious code, or altering business- configurations.
