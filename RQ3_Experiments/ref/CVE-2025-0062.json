        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is exploited through the victim’s browser when they access a maliciously crafted Web Intelligence report. This implies that the attacker does not need access or internal privileges, and can deliver the payload via a shared report or link. The attack surface is therefore exposed through a remote, user-facing interface, making it accessible over standard web protocols. This increases the likelihood of exploitation, especially in environments where reports are frequently shared or accessed via browser-based interfaces.",

      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploit depends on the administrator having enabled script or HTML execution in the Central Management Console, which is not the default configuration in many secure deployments. This prerequisite adds a layer of complexity, as the attacker must either know or assume that this setting is active. However, once this condition is met, the injection of JavaScript into a report is a relatively straightforward task, assuming the attacker has access to report creation or editing features. The complexity is therefore moderate, hinging on environmental configuration rather than technical barriers.",

      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To inject malicious JavaScript into a report, the attacker must have access to the SAP BusinessObjects platform with sufficient permissions to create or modify Web Intelligence reports. This typically requires authenticated access and a role that allows report editing. The attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability without these privileges, meaning they must already be a user within the system with elevated capabilities. This requirement limits the pool of potential attackers and adds a barrier to exploitation, as external unauthenticated users would not be able to perform the attack.",

The malicious code executes only when the vulnerable page is rendered client-side, making user interaction essential. Without the victim accessing the report, the injected script remains dormant. This dependency on user behavior introduces a significant constraint, as the attacker must entice or rely on the victim to engage with the report, either through social engineering or routine usage patterns.",

        "Scope_Reasoning": "The impact of the vulnerability is confined to the victim’s browser environment and does not extend to the underlying SAP BusinessObjects platform or its server-side components. The injected script operates within the context of the user’s session and browser, affecting only what the user can see or interact with. There is no indication that the vulnerability allows privilege escalation or cross-boundary effects between different system components. Therefore, the security boundaries of the application remain intact, and the effects are limited to the user domain.",

However, the impact is constrained to what the victim can access and does not compromise backend databases or broader system confidentiality. The attacker cannot retrieve information beyond the scope of the victim’s session, and the exposure is limited to client-side data. This results in a partial but not systemic breach of confidentiality.",

However, these changes are ephemeral and limited to the browser session; they do not persist in the backend or affect stored data. The attacker cannot modify actual reports or system records unless they already have editing privileges. Thus, the integrity impact is constrained to temporary, client-side distortions rather than permanent or systemic data corruption.",

The injected JavaScript does not disrupt service functionality, crash the browser, or prevent access to reports. The platform continues to operate normally, and users can still interact with the system. Since the exploit does not involve denial-of-service techniques or resource exhaustion, it does not degrade performance or accessibility.
