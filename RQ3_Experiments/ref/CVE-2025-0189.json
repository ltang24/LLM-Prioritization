      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is exploitable through the via websocket connections, which are typically exposed over the internet or internal networks. Since the flaw involves sending oversized image data through a websocket, an attacker can remotely trigger the condition without needing access or proximity. This makes the attack feasible from any location with access to the server’s websocket endpoint, assuming it is not restricted by firewall or authentication mechanisms. The reliance on standard protocols and services increases the exposure surface and simplifies exploitation.",

      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The attack does not appear to require any special conditions or environmental setup beyond the ability to send large image data through an open websocket connection. There is no indication that the attacker must bypass any rate-limiting, perform timing-based actions, or manipulate server state in a complex way. The vulnerability stems from the server’s failure to enforce a maximum message size, which is a predictable and repeatable flaw. This suggests that the attack can be reliably executed with minimal effort or adaptation to different environments.",

      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker only needs access to the websocket interface of the tracking server, which is typically available to unauthenticated users or users with minimal permissions. There is no mention of authentication or role-based access control being to send image data. If the websocket endpoint is publicly accessible or exposed to -privilege users, the attack can be carried out without elevated permissions. This significantly lowers the barrier to exploitation and increases the risk of abuse by external or internal actors.",

        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The vulnerability does not depend on any action or cooperation from a legitimate user. The attacker initiates the exploit by sending a large image payload directly to the server, which then becomes unresponsive. There is no need for a victim to click a link, open a file, or perform any other interaction. The server-side flaw is triggered solely by the attacker’s input, making it a fully autonomous attack vector. This independence from user behavior enhances the reliability and impact of the exploit.",

There is no indication that the vulnerability causes a breach or impact beyond the boundaries of the vulnerable component. The server’s processing resources are consumed, but there is no evidence of privilege escalation, data leakage, or compromise of other systems. Therefore, the impact appears to be contained within the same security authority, without affecting other components or services in a broader system context.",

The flaw is centered around resource exhaustion due to oversized websocket messages, which affects server responsiveness but does not expose internal data. The server becomes unavailable, but it does not leak or transmit confidential information as part of the failure. Therefore, the confidentiality of the system remains intact, assuming no secondary vulnerabilities are triggered during the denial of service condition.",

It causes the server to become unresponsive, but there is no indication that it modifies tracked data, logs, or other stored information. The attack focuses on overwhelming the server’s processing capabilities rather than tampering with its contents.

This results in the server becoming unresponsive to other requests, effectively denying service to legitimate users. The impact is significant because it can disrupt operations, delay data tracking, and prevent access to functionality. The server’s inability to handle concurrent requests during image processing creates a bottleneck that can be exploited repeatedly, leading to prolonged downtime or degraded performance.",
