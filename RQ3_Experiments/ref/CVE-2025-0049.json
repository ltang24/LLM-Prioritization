While this does not directly leak sensitive user data or credentials, it does reveal information that is typically hidden and could be used to plan further attacks. The impact is limited to information disclosure, and the data exposed is structural rather than personal or confidential in nature.

Since the attacker cannot influence the integrity of the system or its data, the impact on integrity is effectively nonexistent.",
