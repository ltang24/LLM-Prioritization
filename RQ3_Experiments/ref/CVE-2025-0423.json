      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through a web interface, as it involves injecting malicious JavaScript into stored fields that are later rendered in users' browsers. This means the attacker does not need access or proximity to the system. The attack can be carried out over a , such as the internet, by submitting crafted input to the application. Since the malicious payload is stored and later executed in the victim’s browser, the attacker can target users without needing to interact with them directly, making the attack vector broad and accessible.",

        }
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The attack requires minimal effort beyond crafting a suitable JavaScript payload and identifying an input field that is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting. There are no indications of unpredictable conditions or environmental factors that would hinder exploitation. The attacker does not need to bypass any complex defenses or perform timing-dependent actions. Once the payload is injected, it executes automatically when a user accesses the affected page, suggesting that the process is straightforward and repeatable across different sessions and users.",

        }
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need to authenticate or possess any privileges within the application to exploit the vulnerability. The description explicitly states that the cross-site scripting is unauthenticated and stored, meaning any external user can submit malicious input. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for exploitation, as no account creation, login, or elevated permissions are . The attacker can operate entirely outside the bounds of the application's access control mechanisms, making the vulnerability more severe in terms of exposure.",

        }
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "Successful exploitation depends on a legitimate user accessing the compromised content where the malicious script is stored. The script executes in the user's browser, implying that the user must load or view the affected page. This constitutes a form of indirect interaction, as the attacker cannot trigger the impact without the user’s browser rendering the injected code. Although the user does not need to click or perform any specific action beyond normal usage, their involvement is necessary for the attack to succeed.",

      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The attack affects the user’s session and potentially their privileges within the application, but it does not appear to alter the underlying security boundaries of the system itself. The attacker abuses the victim’s session to perform actions on their behalf, which implies that the impact is confined to the same security context. There is no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to escalate privileges across different components or breach isolation between different parts of the system architecture.",

        }
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "By hijacking user sessions through injected scripts, the attacker may gain access to sensitive information available to the victim, such as personal data, internal messages, or configuration details. The extent of data exposure depends on what the compromised user can access. If the victim has elevated privileges, the attacker could potentially retrieve confidential information that would otherwise be protected. This indirect access to data through session riding introduces a meaningful risk to confidentiality, especially in multi-user environments.",

      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The attacker can perform actions on behalf of the victim, which may include modifying data, submitting forms, or altering configurations. This undermines the integrity of the application by allowing unauthorized changes through impersonation. The impact is magnified if the victim has administrative or write privileges, as the attacker could manipulate records or settings. The trust model of the application is compromised, since actions appear to originate from legitimate users but are actually controlled by the attacker.",

      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "There is no direct indication that the vulnerability affects the availability of the application or its services. Stored cross-site scripting typically targets data theft or manipulation rather than service disruption. While it is theoretically possible for an attacker to inject scripts that degrade performance or crash the browser, such outcomes are not guaranteed or inherent to the described behavior. Therefore, the impact on availability is likely limited unless combined with other techniques or payloads designed to exhaust resources.",
