        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending repeated requests to a specific endpoint exposed over HTTP, namely /auth/saml/callback. This implies that exploitation can occur remotely over a without requiring access or proximity. Since the endpoint is part of a web application, it is likely accessible via standard internet protocols, making it susceptible to remote attacks from any location. The attacker only needs the ability to send crafted requests to the server, which is a common capability in most threat scenarios involving public-facing APIs.",

The attacker simply sends multiple requests to the vulnerable endpoint, which leads to memory exhaustion. There is no indication of needing to bypass authentication, manipulate session states, or coordinate with other system components.
