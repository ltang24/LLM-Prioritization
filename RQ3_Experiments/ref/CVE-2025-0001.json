      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is exploitable through a crafted URL targeting a flawed API route, which implies that the attack can be conducted remotely over a . The attacker does not need access to the system and can interact with the vulnerable component via standard web protocols. This increases the exposure of the vulnerability, as systems accessible over the internet or internal networks could be targeted without requiring proximity or access. The use of a user-controlled absolute path in the API further supports remote exploitation through HTTP requests.",

      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The attack requires knowledge of specific file paths and the ability to craft a malicious URL that triggers the vulnerable API route. While this does introduce some complexity, the description suggests that the attacker can succeed with predictable paths and known techniques. The need to identify the JWT signing key file and understand the API behavior adds a layer of sophistication, but it does not appear to require advanced or unpredictable conditions. The vulnerability was discovered during a white-box audit, indicating that with sufficient information, exploitation is feasible.",

        }
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker must be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, meaning they need valid credentials or access to an account with sufficient permissions to invoke the affected API route. This requirement significantly limits the pool of potential attackers, as they must first gain access to the system legitimately or through other means. The description does not specify whether elevated privileges are needed, but the fact that authentication is implies that the attacker cannot exploit the issue anonymously or without some level of access.",

      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "There is no indication that the attack requires any action from another user, such as clicking a link or opening a file. The attacker can execute the exploit independently by crafting and sending a malicious request to the vulnerable API. This means the success of the attack does not depend on social engineering or user behavior, which simplifies the exploitation process and makes it more reliable. The vulnerability is purely technical and does not rely on human factors.",

      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows the attacker to extract the JWT signing key and forge tokens to impersonate other users, which affects the authorization context across the application. This suggests that the impact extends beyond the initially compromised account or component, potentially affecting other users and services that rely on the same authentication mechanism. The ability to forge tokens and access resources as different users implies a change in security boundaries, as the attacker can escalate privileges and access unrelated parts of the system.",

      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "By reading arbitrary files, including the JWT signing key, the attacker gains access to sensitive information that should be protected. This enables further unauthorized access to user data and system resources. The ability to impersonate other users through forged tokens exacerbates the confidentiality impact, as the attacker can retrieve private data belonging to other accounts. The exposure of the signing key compromises the integrity of the authentication system, leading to widespread data leakage risks.",

      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Once the attacker obtains the JWT signing key, they can forge tokens and perform actions as other users, including those with elevated privileges. This undermines the integrity of the system by allowing unauthorized modifications to data, configurations, or transactions. The attacker can potentially alter records, submit fraudulent requests, or manipulate business logic, all while appearing as a legitimate user. The trust model of the application is broken, as forged tokens bypass normal access controls.",

      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, with no direct indication of system downtime or resource exhaustion. However, if the attacker uses forged tokens to perform disruptive actions, such as deleting data or overloading services, availability could be indirectly impacted. Still, the core exploit—reading files and forging tokens—does not inherently cause denial of service or prevent legitimate users from accessing the system. Therefore, any availability impact would be secondary and dependent on attacker behavior.",
