Stored cross-site scripting typically involves straightforward injection into persistent fields, such as comments or user profiles. There is no indication of timing, race conditions, or environmental dependencies that would complicate exploitation. Therefore, the attacker’s success largely depends on identifying the vulnerable input and submitting the payload, which is relatively simple.",

This implies that the attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability anonymously and must first authenticate or otherwise gain access to a user account.

This could allow the attacker to read private messages, extract credentials, or impersonate the victim. The extent of data exposure depends on what the vulnerable page contains and how the application handles session management, but there is a clear risk of unauthorized data access.",

This undermines the trustworthiness of the application’s output and could lead to fraudulent actions or misinformation. While the attacker cannot modify server-side data directly, the ability to tamper with client-side presentation and interactions constitutes a meaningful compromise of data integrity from the user’s perspective.",
