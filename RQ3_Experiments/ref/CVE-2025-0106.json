      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a connection, as it allows unauthenticated attackers to enumerate files on the host system without requiring access or execution. This implies that the attacker can initiate the exploit from a separate system, likely through HTTP or another exposed service interface. The Expedition tool is designed to be accessed via a web interface, which further supports the assumption that the attack surface is -based. No shell or proximity is needed to trigger the vulnerability.",

      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The vulnerability stems from improper wildcard expansion, which typically does not require complex conditions or environmental setup to exploit. The attacker does not need to manipulate timing, race conditions, or specific system states. The flaw is inherent in how the application processes input, meaning that a crafted request or input string is likely sufficient to trigger the file enumeration behavior. There are no indications of mitigation mechanisms or unpredictable variables that would make exploitation more difficult.",

      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need to authenticate or possess any user credentials to exploit the vulnerability. The flaw is accessible to unauthenticated users, meaning that it resides in a portion of the application exposed prior to any login or access control enforcement. This significantly broadens the attack surface, as any external actor can potentially exploit the issue without first compromising a user account or escalating privileges within the system.",

      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "There is no indication that the exploit requires any form of user involvement, such as clicking a link, opening a file, or performing an action within the application. The attacker can trigger the vulnerability independently, without relying on social engineering or user behavior. This suggests that the vulnerability is purely server-side and can be activated through direct requests to the affected system, making it more dangerous in automated or mass exploitation scenarios.",

However, the exposure of sensitive data such as firewall credentials and API keys could indirectly impact other systems that rely on this data. Despite this, the vulnerability does not alter the security properties of other components directly; it remains confined to the Expedition environment. Therefore, the exploit does not cause a shift in the trust boundary or affect other security domains.",

Unauthorized access to these files could allow attackers to gain insight into architecture, authentication mechanisms, and potentially compromise other systems. The impact is substantial because the data involved is to the security posture of the organization using the tool.",

The description focuses on file enumeration, which is a read-only operation.

File enumeration, while potentially exposing sensitive data, does not result in denial of service, resource exhaustion, or system crashes.
