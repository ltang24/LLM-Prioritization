      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a crafted request to a WordPress site using the affected plugin. Since the flaw resides in a callback function exposed through the web interface, an attacker does not need access or proximity to the server. The attack can be launched over the internet using standard HTTP requests, making it feasible for threat actors to target vulnerable sites at scale without specialized infrastructure or insider access. This significantly broadens the potential attack surface and increases the risk of exploitation across publicly accessible WordPress installations.",

      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation process appears straightforward, requiring only knowledge of a valid username and the ability to send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint. There are no indications of unpredictable conditions, race conditions, or environmental dependencies that would complicate the attack. The flaw stems from incorrect authentication logic, which likely fails to properly verify credentials, allowing attackers to bypass login checks. This suggests that the exploit does not rely on chaining multiple vulnerabilities or manipulating system states, making it relatively easy to reproduce once the vulnerable function is identified.",

      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need to be logged into the system or possess any existing credentials to initiate the attack. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to impersonate any valid account, including administrative ones, provided they know the username. This means the attacker starts with no privileges and gains full access through the exploit. The lack of prerequisite access significantly lowers the barrier to entry for exploitation and increases the severity of the vulnerability, especially in environments where usernames are easily guessable or publicly known.",

        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "No user interaction is for the attacker to exploit this vulnerability. The flaw resides in server-side authentication logic and can be triggered solely by sending a malicious request to the affected endpoint. Users do not need to click links, open attachments, or perform any action that would facilitate the attack. This makes the vulnerability more dangerous, as it can be exploited without social engineering or phishing tactics. The absence of user involvement also means that automated attacks are more feasible, increasing the likelihood of widespread exploitation.",

      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to assume the identity of any user, including administrators, which can lead to changes in system-wide settings, plugin configurations, and user permissions. This indicates that the impact is not confined to the vulnerable plugin alone but extends to the broader WordPress environment. By gaining administrative access, the attacker can affect components outside the original security context of the plugin, such as installing malicious plugins, modifying themes, or accessing sensitive data. This cross-boundary impact suggests a shift in the overall security authority within the application.",

This may include user email addresses, private messages, configuration files, and potentially database contents depending on the plugin’s integration. The attacker could also exfiltrate data or create new accounts to maintain persistence. The unauthorized access to user-specific and system-wide data compromises the confidentiality of the site and its users, especially if the site handles personal or financial information.",

      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "By impersonating an administrator, the attacker can modify content, alter plugin settings, change user roles, and inject malicious code into posts or pages. This undermines the trustworthiness of the site’s content and may lead to defacement, misinformation, or the distribution of malware. The ability to tamper with system configurations and user-generated content poses a serious threat to data integrity. Furthermore, the attacker could manipulate audit logs or disable security plugins, making it harder to detect or remediate the breach.",

While the vulnerability itself does not directly cause a denial of service, the level of access it grants enables actions that can severely disrupt site functionality. The attacker could also install resource-intensive plugins or scripts that degrade performance.
