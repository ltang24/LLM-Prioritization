Exploitation involves uploading a malicious SVG file and embedding it in a post, which implies that the attack occurs through the web application interface. Since the attack is performed remotely via HTTP requests and does not require physical access or local execution on the server, the vector is through a network-accessible service exposed by the WordPress plugin.\",\n  \n  \"Attack_Complexity_Reasoning\": \"The exploitation process is relatively straightforward once the attacker has the required privileges. The attacker needs to craft a malicious SVG file containing executable PHP code and then use the plugin’s vulnerable get_svg() function to include and execute it. No specialized conditions or environmental factors are required beyond what is already provided by the plugin’s default behavior. The plugin does not appear to have additional mitigations or randomness that would complicate exploitation, making the complexity low.\",\n  \n  \"Privileges_Required_Reasoning\": \"The attacker must have Contributor-level access or higher to exploit the vulnerability. This means they need to be logged in and have sufficient permissions to upload files and create posts. While Contributor access is not the lowest possible privilege, it is commonly granted to users who contribute content, and does not require administrative or elevated roles. Therefore, the attack cannot be performed by unauthenticated users, but it also does not require high-level administrative access.\",\n  \n  \"User_Interaction_Reasoning\": \"The attacker does not need any additional user to perform an action for the exploit to succeed.
