      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability arises from an unquoted search path in a locally installed service, meaning exploitation requires access to the system where the AMD Cloud Manageability Service is installed. An attacker must place a malicious executable in a location that is searched before the legitimate binary. This implies or logical access to the target machine, such as through a account or compromised software already present. Remote exploitation is not feasible unless combined with another vulnerability that grants access.",

        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting an unquoted search path vulnerability typically involves placing a malicious executable in a directory that is searched before the intended executable due to improper path quoting. This technique is well-understood and does not require advanced skills or bypassing complex protections. The attacker does not need to manipulate timing or race conditions, nor does the exploit depend on unpredictable environmental factors. Therefore, the steps to reproduce the issue are straightforward once access is obtained.",

      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To exploit this issue, the attacker must have sufficient privileges to write files to directories that are part of the vulnerable search path. This usually requires a -level account with write access to certain system folders or application directories. The attacker does not need administrative rights to initiate the exploit, but the goal is to escalate privileges to a higher level, such as system or root. Therefore, initial access is limited but not entirely unrestricted.",

        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "Successful exploitation depends on the vulnerable service being executed, which may occur automatically during system startup or through user actions. If the service is not running continuously, the attacker may need to wait for or induce a user to start the application. This introduces a dependency on user behavior, even if indirect. The exploit does not require the user to open a malicious file or click a link, but their interaction with the system may be necessary to trigger the vulnerable code path.",

There is no indication that the exploit causes a change in security boundaries between different components or systems. The compromised service remains within its original domain, and the attacker gains elevated privileges without affecting other trust zones or containers. Therefore, the impact is confined to the scope of the vulnerable service.",

      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "Once the attacker escalates privileges, they may gain access to sensitive data stored on the system, including credentials, configuration files, or user documents. The ability to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges allows the attacker to bypass access controls and read protected information. This could include data from other users or system-level secrets, depending on the environment. The breach of confidentiality is significant due to the potential reach of the compromised service.",

        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges enables the attacker to modify system files, application binaries, or configuration settings. This can compromise the integrity of the operating system and installed software. The attacker may install persistent backdoors, alter logs to hide activity, or tamper with security controls. The ability to write and execute code at a privileged level poses a serious threat to the trustworthiness of the systemâ€™s data and operations.",
