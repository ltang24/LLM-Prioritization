      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability requires the attacker to access the PAN-OS CLI via the management interface, which includes protocols like SSH, web, console, or telnet. This implies that exploitation is only possible from within the or through remote access to a management interface, not through general internet exposure. The need for access to a specific administrative interface significantly limits the exposure surface, as these interfaces are typically segmented from public-facing services and protected by firewalls or access controls.",

        }
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Once authenticated access to the CLI is obtained, the exploitation of the vulnerability appears straightforward. There are no indications of race conditions, timing dependencies, or environmental factors that would complicate exploitation. The attacker does not need to manipulate system state or perform any unusual configuration steps. Therefore, the technical steps to exploit the issue are minimal, assuming the attacker has the necessary access and privileges.",

      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker must be an authenticated administrator on the PAN-OS CLI, which implies elevated privileges. This is not a general user or -level account; it is someone with administrative capabilities. While this level of access is significant, it is not the highest possible (e.g., root on the underlying OS), and such access may be granted to multiple individuals in an organization. The requirement for admin-level access reduces the likelihood of exploitation but does not eliminate it, especially in environments with poor access control hygiene.",

      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "There is no indication that any user other than the attacker needs to perform an action for the vulnerability to be exploited. The attacker, once authenticated, can execute commands directly via the CLI to read arbitrary files. No phishing, social engineering, or user-triggered events are necessary. This makes the vulnerability more straightforward to exploit once access is obtained, as it does not rely on external cooperation or accidental user behavior.",

      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files within the PAN-OS environment, but there is no indication that it affects other components or systems beyond the PAN-OS itself. The impact is confined to the same security boundary—the PAN-OS device—and does not extend to other systems or services. Therefore, the security authority remains , and the effects are limited to the environment in which the vulnerability resides.",

        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The ability to read arbitrary files as an authenticated admin can expose sensitive configuration data, credentials, logs, or other internal information. This could lead to significant data leakage, especially if the attacker targets files containing user credentials, VPN keys, or policy definitions. The impact is substantial because it compromises the confidentiality of potentially information stored on the device, which could be leveraged for further attacks or lateral movement.",
