      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by sending specially crafted packets to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway. Since the attacker does not need access or proximity to the device, and the attack can be conducted over the internet, the exposure is broad. The fact that the service is -facing and accessible to unauthenticated users further supports the conclusion that the attack vector is remote and does not require or access. This significantly increases the potential reach of the attack.",

        }

      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The attack requires sending a large number of specially crafted packets over time, which implies that the attacker must understand the protocol and craft packets in a specific way to trigger the denial of service. This suggests that the attack is not trivial and may require knowledge of the PAN-OS GlobalProtect implementation. Additionally, the need to sustain the attack over a period of time introduces timing and resource coordination challenges, which further increases the complexity of successful exploitation.",

        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need to authenticate or possess any credentials to exploit the vulnerability. The description explicitly states that the attack is performed by an unauthenticated actor, meaning no prior access or elevated privileges are necessary.

        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "There is no indication that the attack requires any action from a legitimate user of the system. The denial of service is triggered solely by the attacker sending crafted packets, and users are not involved in initiating or facilitating the exploit. This means the vulnerability can be exploited without tricking or engaging any user, which simplifies the attack path and removes social engineering or phishing from the equation.",

There is no indication that sensitive information is exposed, intercepted, or modified during exploitation. The attack focuses solely on rendering the service unavailable, and the description confirms that confidentiality remains unaffected.

The exploit does not involve tampering with files, injecting malicious content, or modifying system outputs. The sole effect is service disruption, and the system’s data and operational correctness remain intact. Thus, the integrity of the system is not impacted by this vulnerability.",

This disrupts remote access functionality, which can severely impact organizational operations that rely on VPN connectivity. The service becomes unusable, and recovery may require manual intervention or system reboot. The impact is significant because it prevents legitimate users from accessing resources.",
