The attacker could retrieve confidential data without detection, posing a serious risk to privacy and data protection.\",\n  \n  \"Integrity_Impact_Reasoning\": \"By executing arbitrary commands, an attacker could modify system files, alter configurations, or inject malicious scripts into the device. This compromises the integrity of the system, as unauthorized changes can affect how the device operates, potentially leading to tampering with surveillance data or disabling security features. The attacker could also install persistent backdoors, further undermining the trustworthiness of the system.\",\n  \n  \"Availability_Impact_Reasoning\": \"Command injection can be used to disrupt system functionality, such as deleting critical files, terminating processes, or initiating resource exhaustion attacks. These actions could render the camera system inoperable, either temporarily or permanently, depending on the severity of the commands executed. Given the remote nature of the attack and lack of authentication, attackers could easily launch denial-of-service scenarios against multiple devices simultaneously.\"\n}\n```",
