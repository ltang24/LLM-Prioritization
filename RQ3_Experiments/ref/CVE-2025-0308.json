      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through a web-based interface, specifically via the search parameter in the plugin. This means an attacker does not need access or proximity to the target system. The attack can be carried out over the internet by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. Since WordPress plugins are typically exposed to public users, especially in membership or directory contexts, the attack surface is broad and accessible from virtually anywhere, increasing the risk of exploitation without requiring or internal access.",

      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation method involves time-based SQL injection, which is a well-documented and widely understood technique. While it may require some trial-and-error to fine-tune the payloads and measure response delays, the underlying vulnerability stems from predictable flaws in input sanitization and query construction. No specialized conditions or environmental factors are needed beyond the plugin being active and the vulnerable endpoint being reachable. Therefore, the complexity is relatively , as attackers can use automated tools to detect and exploit the flaw with minimal effort.",

      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, meaning no login or elevated permissions are to launch the attack. The plugin fails to properly sanitize input from public-facing components, allowing attackers to inject SQL commands without needing access credentials. This significantly increases the risk, as any external user can potentially exploit the flaw without first compromising an account or gaining insider access. The lack of access control on the vulnerable parameter makes it highly accessible to attackers.",

      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "No user interaction is for the attack to succeed. The attacker can directly send malicious requests to the vulnerable endpoint without relying on any actions from legitimate users, such as clicking links, opening attachments, or performing specific tasks. The plugin processes the input autonomously, and the SQL injection occurs entirely on the server side. This means the exploit does not depend on social engineering or user behavior, making it easier to automate and execute without detection.",

There is no indication that the attack causes a privilege boundary to be crossed or affects components outside the WordPress environment. The impact remains confined to the plugin and its associated database operations. Although sensitive data may be exposed, the attack does not appear to alter the execution context or compromise other systems beyond the application itself.",

This could include user credentials, personal data, or other confidential records stored by the plugin or WordPress itself. Since the attacker can manipulate queries to retrieve specific fields, the exposure is potentially significant. The ability to access data without authentication poses a serious threat to privacy and data protection, especially for sites handling user profiles and membership information.",

Time-based SQL injection typically focuses on reading data by observing response delays, rather than altering database contents. However, depending on the query structure and database permissions, an attacker might be able to craft payloads that affect data integrity. Still, the primary risk appears to be unauthorized access rather than tampering, making the impact on integrity less certain without further context.",

If exploited repeatedly or in parallel, this could lead to resource exhaustion or slow response times, affecting the availability of the application. However, the attack does not inherently crash the system or cause persistent denial of service. The impact on availability is more indirect and depends on the frequency and scale of exploitation.
