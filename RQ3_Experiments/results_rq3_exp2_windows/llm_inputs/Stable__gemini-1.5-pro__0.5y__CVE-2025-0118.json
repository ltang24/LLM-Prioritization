This enables the attacker to run commands as if they are a\nlegitimate authenticated user. However, to exploit this vulnerability, the\nauthenticated user must navigate to a malicious page during the GlobalProtect\nSAML login process on a Windows device. This issue does not apply to the\nGlobalProtect app on other (non-Windows) platforms..
