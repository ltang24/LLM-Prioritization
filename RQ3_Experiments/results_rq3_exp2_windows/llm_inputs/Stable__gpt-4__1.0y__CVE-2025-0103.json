The issue stems from improper sanitization of user-supplied input\nwithin Expedition’s database query logic, allowing authenticated users with\nstandard access privileges to inject malicious SQL statements into backend\noperations. This vulnerability enables attackers to extract sensitive database\ncontents such as password hashes, usernames, device configurations, and API\nkeys, and further permits unauthorized creation and reading of arbitrary files\non the host system. The attack surface is exposed through Expedition’s normal\ninput channels, requiring no phy..."
