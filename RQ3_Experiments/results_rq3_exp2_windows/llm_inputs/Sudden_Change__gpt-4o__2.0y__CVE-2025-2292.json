This issue arises from improper restrictions on\npathname handling, allowing attackers to manipulate file paths and access\nsensitive files that should remain protected. Exploitation of this vulnerability\ncan occur through standard input mechanisms, where an attacker, possessing basic\nauthenticated access, can craft requests to trigger the vulnerable code path\nwithout needing any special conditions or proximity. The complexity of the\nattack is relatively low, as it relies on typical data parsing and handling\nprocesses inherent to the appl..."
