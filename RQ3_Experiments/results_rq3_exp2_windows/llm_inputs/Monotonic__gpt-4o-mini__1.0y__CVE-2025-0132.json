The vulnerability stems from a failure to enforce\naccess control on operations that should be gated behind authentication,\nspecifically those tied to service management within the Broker VM. Exploitation\nrequires network-level access to the Broker VM, but no elevated privileges or\nuser interaction are necessary once the vulnerable interface is exposed. The\nattack surface is broad, as the flaw resides in a normally accessible input\npath, and exploitation relies on standard request handling without requiring\ntiming manipulation or envi..."
