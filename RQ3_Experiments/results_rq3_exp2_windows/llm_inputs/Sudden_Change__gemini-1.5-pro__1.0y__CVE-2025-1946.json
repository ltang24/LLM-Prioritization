The flaw stems from\nimproper handling of user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter, which is\ndirectly incorporated into system-level command execution without adequate\nsanitization or validation. This oversight enables remote attackers to inject\narbitrary commands via crafted HTTP requests, leveraging the web-accessible\nnature of the endpoint to initiate exploitation from any location without\nrequiring physical access or proximity. The attack does not depend on complex\nenvironmental conditions or multi-step procedures, making it relatively simple\nto execute once the vulnerable in..."
