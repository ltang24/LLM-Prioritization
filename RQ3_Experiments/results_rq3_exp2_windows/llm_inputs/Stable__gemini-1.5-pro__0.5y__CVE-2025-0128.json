The\nvulnerability arises from improper handling of exceptional conditions within the\nSimple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) authentication feature, allowing\nan unauthenticated attacker to send specially crafted packets that can trigger\nsystem reboots. This exploitation mechanism can lead to the firewall entering\nmaintenance mode after repeated attempts, effectively disrupting service\navailability. The attack vector is straightforward, as the vulnerable operation\nis accessible through ..."
