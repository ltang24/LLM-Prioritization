The flaw stems from an inadequate exception handling\nmechanism—specifically, the absence of a safeguard against anomalous conditions\ntriggered by malformed network traffic. An unauthenticated attacker can remotely\nexploit this weakness by sending a carefully timed and formatted burst of\nmalicious packets to the firewall’s web proxy interface, causing the device to\nbecome unresponsive and ultimately reboot. If the attack is repeated\nsuccessfully, the firewall may enter maintenance mode, requiring manual\nintervention to restore functionalit..."
