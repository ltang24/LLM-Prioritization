This flaw stems from improper\nvalidation of externally supplied file paths, allowing adversaries to manipulate\ninput parameters that control file operations, consistent with the weakness\ncategory involving external control of file names or paths. The vulnerability is\naccessible remotely via standard network exposure of the management interface,\nrequiring no authentication or elevated privileges, which significantly lowers\nthe barrier to exploitation.
