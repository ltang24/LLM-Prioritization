The vulnerability\nstems from a use-after-free condition within the GPU kernel driver, where memory\npreviously allocated and subsequently released remains accessible through\nimproper GPU memory operations initiated by a local user-space process. This\nflaw enables a non-privileged user to interact directly with the GPU driver and\naccess memory regions that should no longer be available, potentially exposing\nsensitive data such as cryptographic material, user credentials, or internal\ndriver state. Because the vulnerability resides in kernel-level code and does\nnot require elevated p..."
