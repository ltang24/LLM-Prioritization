The flaw\nstems from an integer wraparound condition tied to the 32-bit time\nrepresentation limit, specifically when a low-privileged user sets the system\ndate to January 19, 2038. This action causes the internal time counter to exceed\nits maximum representable value, resulting in unpredictable behavior or complete\nfailure of time-dependent functions both during active operation and after\nreboot. The vulnerability is rooted in improper handling of time values, where\nthe system fails to validate or constrain user-supplied date inputs, allowing\noverflow into an invalid state...."
