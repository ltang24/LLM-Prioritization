The flaw stems from the system’s\nfailure to properly sanitize or constrain incoming data during login attempts,\nallowing crafted inputs to traverse the normal authentication pathway and reach\nsensitive code branches that are not equipped to handle malformed or excessive\npayloads. This leads to resource exhaustion or service instability, effectively\ndisrupting availability without breaching other security boundaries. The attack\nsurface is exposed through standard network interfaces, and exploitation does\nnot require physic..."
