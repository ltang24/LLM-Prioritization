The server overrides the maximum size for websocket messages,\nallowing very large images to be tracked. This causes the server to become\nunresponsive to other requests while processing the large image, leading to a\ndenial of service condition.. Regarding attack vector, analysis indicates that\nThe vulnerability is exploitable through the via websocket connections, which\nare typically exposed over the internet or internal networks. Since the flaw\ninvolves sending oversized image data through a websocket, an attacker can\nremotely trigger the condition without needing access or proximity. This makes\nthe attack feasible fr..."
