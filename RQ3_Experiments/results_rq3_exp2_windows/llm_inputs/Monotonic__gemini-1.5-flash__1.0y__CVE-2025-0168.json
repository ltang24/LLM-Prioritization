The\nvulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input in the\n'person' parameter, which is directly incorporated into backend SQL queries\nwithout adequate sanitization or validation. This oversight enables remote\nattackers to craft malicious HTTP requests containing specially formed input\nthat manipulates the SQL logic, thereby facilitating unauthorized access to the\nunderlying database.
