The vulnerability arises from\ninsufficient neutralization of special characters in command strings, enabling\nattackers to bypass intended input constraints and directly invoke system-level\ninstructions. Exploitation requires access to the Broker VM interface, but no\nelevated privileges beyond basic authentication, making the barrier to entry\nrelatively low for insiders or those with compromised credentials.
