This flaw arises from improper handling of arithmetic\noperations in Skia’s memory allocation routines, which, when fed with specially\nstructured input, can result in heap corruption. The vulnerability is\nexploitable through standard web browsing activity, requiring only that a user\nvisit a compromised or attacker-controlled webpage; no elevated privileges or\nauthentication are necessary, and the exploit can be delivered remotely without\nphysical access.
