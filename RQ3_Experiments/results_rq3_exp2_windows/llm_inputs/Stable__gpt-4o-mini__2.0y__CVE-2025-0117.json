The vulnerability stems from a flawed\nsecurity decision-making process that relies on input which is not properly\nvalidated or trusted, allowing a locally authenticated user with standard\nprivileges to manipulate the application’s logic and elevate their access to the\nhighest system authority. This escalation is achieved without requiring any\ninteraction from other users and does not depend on unusual system\nconfigurations or environmental conditions, making the exploit path\nstraightforward and consistently viable across vulner..."
