The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input\nin the argument, which is passed unsanitized into system-level command execution\nroutines. This allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary commands through\nstandard HTTP request mechanisms, leveraging the application's exposed interface\nwithout requiring elevated privileges or complex environmental conditions. The\nexploit path is straightforward, relying on typical input parsing and execution\nflow, and does not necessitate user interaction beyond the initial request\nsubmission.
