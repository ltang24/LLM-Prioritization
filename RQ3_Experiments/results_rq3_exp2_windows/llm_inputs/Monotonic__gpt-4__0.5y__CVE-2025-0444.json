The flaw arises when memory previously\nallocated for graphical operations is improperly released and subsequently\naccessed, leading to heap corruption. This condition can be triggered remotely\nby rendering a maliciously crafted HTML page, allowing an attacker to manipulate\nmemory structures during normal browser operations. Exploitation does not\nrequire any special privileges or authentication, as the vulnerability is\nactivated through standard web browsing behavior, making it accessible to threat\nactors operating entirely outside the target system.
