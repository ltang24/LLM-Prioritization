This flaw can be exploited\nby malware or unauthorized users who have already gained access to the system,\nthereby enabling them to circumvent the agent's protective capabilities and\nengage in malicious activities without detection. The exploitation process is\nrelatively straightforward, requiring no special conditions beyond access to the\nvulnerable system, which limits the attack surface to environments where the\nattacker has already established a foothold.
