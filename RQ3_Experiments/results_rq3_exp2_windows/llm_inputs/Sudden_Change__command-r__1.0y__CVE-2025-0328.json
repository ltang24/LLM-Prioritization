The flaw stems from\nimproper sanitization of user-supplied input passed via the 'code' parameter,\nallowing remote attackers to inject and execute arbitrary system-level commands\non the server. Because the vulnerable endpoint is publicly accessible and does\nnot require authentication, exploitation can be initiated by any unauthenticated\nactor over the internet without proximity or prior access. The attack mechanism\nis technically straightforward, requiring only a crafted POST request with\nmalicious payloads such as embedded PHP system calls, which are processed\nwithout validation.
