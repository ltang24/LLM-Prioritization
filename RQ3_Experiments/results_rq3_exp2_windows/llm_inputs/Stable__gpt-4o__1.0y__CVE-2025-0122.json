The\nflaw stems from inadequate resource management, specifically the absence of\nthrottling mechanisms during packet allocation and processing, which allows the\ndevice’s internal buffers and computational resources to be overwhelmed. This\ncondition arises without requiring authentication, as the vulnerable code path\nis exposed through standard network interfaces, making it accessible to any\nactor with adjacent network access. The exploit does not demand complex timing\nor environmental c..."
