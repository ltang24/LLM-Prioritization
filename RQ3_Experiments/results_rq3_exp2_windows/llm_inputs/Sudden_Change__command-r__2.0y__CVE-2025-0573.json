The flaw stems from\ninsufficient validation of user-supplied input during DICOM file parsing,\nspecifically failing to constrain path traversal sequences that manipulate file\nsystem locations. This oversight enables attackers to craft malicious DCM files\ncontaining directory traversal payloads that, when processed by the server,\nresult in unauthorized file creation within the execution context of the\nservice. The vulnerability is exposed through standard network interfaces and\ndoes not require physical access or elevated privileges, making it accessible to\nremote threat actors operatin..."
