The\nvulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition, where GPU processing\noperations initiated by a local, non-privileged process can access memory\nregions that have already been released, leading to unpredictable behavior and\npotential compromise of system integrity. This flaw arises due to improper\nlifecycle handling of memory objects within the kernel driver, allowing stale\npointers to be dereferenced during subsequent GPU task execution. The attack\nsurface is exposed through standard input channels of the driver, requiring no\nphysical access or specialized conditions b..."
