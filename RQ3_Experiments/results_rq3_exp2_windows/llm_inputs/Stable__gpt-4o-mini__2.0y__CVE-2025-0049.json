The flaw stems from improper\nhandling of file upload requests directed at non-existent directories, resulting\nin verbose error messages that expose internal system architecture. This\nbehavior is rooted in insufficient sanitization and overly detailed exception\nreporting, categorized under the generation of error messages containing\nsensitive information. Exploitation requires only basic user-level\nauthentication and deliberate interaction with the web interface, specifically\nby submitting a crafted upload request to an..."
