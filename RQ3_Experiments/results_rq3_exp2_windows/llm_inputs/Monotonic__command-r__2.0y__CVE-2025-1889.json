This oversight allows adversaries to\ncraft malicious PyTorch model archives that include non-standard pickle files\ncontaining arbitrary code, effectively bypassing picklescan’s security checks.\nThe vulnerability stems from an overreliance on file naming conventions rather\nthan content inspection, leading to a false sense of safety when models are\nscanned. Exploitation is feasible remotely, as attackers can distribute\ncompromised models via public repositories or internal package managers without\nrequiring physical access or elevated privileges.
