The vulnerability stems\nfrom improper handling of special characters in command inputs, allowing an\nauthenticated administrator to circumvent system-level restrictions and execute\narbitrary commands with root privileges. This issue is confined to virtualized\ninstances of PAN-OS and does not impact firewalls that have already been\ndeployed, suggesting the flaw resides in pre-deployment configurations or\nmanagement interfaces. Exploitation requires administrative access, which\ninherently limits the threat actor pool but significantly amplifies the\npotential impact due to the elevated p..."
