This behavior inadvertently introduces a\nconfidentiality risk, as the stored input—potentially containing sensitive\ntransactional data such as credentials, personal identifiers, or financial\nrecords—is saved in an unencrypted format within the user's directory. The\nvulnerability arises from insufficient isolation between application-level data\nand the underlying operating system, allowing an attacker with administrative\nprivileges or equivalent access to the victim’s file system to retrieve this\ninformation without needing to bypass complex security mechanisms or rely on\nunpredictable conditions.
