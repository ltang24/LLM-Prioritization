The vulnerability stems\nfrom unsanitized processing of the “retry” parameter, which permits remote\nattackers to inject arbitrary system commands via crafted HTTP POST requests.\nThis flaw is exposed through a publicly accessible web interface, requiring no\nauthentication or user interaction, thereby enabling adversaries to exploit it\nwithout any prior access or specialized conditions. The simplicity of the\nattack—manipulating a single input field—combined with the absence of privilege\nchecks and the public availability of exploit code, significantly amplifies the\nrisk profile.
