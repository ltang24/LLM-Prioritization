The flaw stems from insufficient sanitization of\nuser-supplied data during login operations, allowing crafted inputs to traverse\nthe normal authentication pathway and reach sensitive backend logic. This leads\nto resource exhaustion or service disruption, particularly when malicious actors\nrepeatedly invoke the vulnerable flow with malformed payloads. The attack\nsurface is exposed through standard network interfaces, and exploitation does\nnot require physical access or elevated privileges beyond those of a typical\nauthenticated user. The a..."
