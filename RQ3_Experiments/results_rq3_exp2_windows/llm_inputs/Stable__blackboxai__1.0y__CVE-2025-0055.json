The vulnerability stems from insufficient isolation of stored input\ndata within the user’s operating system directory, allowing an attacker with\nadministrative rights or direct access to the victim’s user profile to extract\npotentially sensitive information. The flaw does not require physical proximity\nor specialized attack infrastructure; instead, it is accessible through standard\ninput channels of the application, making the vulnerable code path reachable via\nroutine usage patterns.
