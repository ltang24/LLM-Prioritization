The vulnerability stems\nfrom improper handling of session identifiers during the SAML login flow,\nallowing an attacker to predefine a session and subsequently hijack it once the\nlegitimate user authenticates. Exploitation requires the attacker to deliver a\ncrafted link—typically via email, messaging apps, or web content—and persuade\nthe target to engage with it, introducing a social engineering dependency but no\ntechnical barriers beyond ..."
