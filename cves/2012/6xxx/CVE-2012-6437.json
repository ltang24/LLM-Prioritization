Where possible, they suggest you apply multiple recommendations and complement this list with your own best-practices:\n\n  *  Employ layered security and defense-in-depth methods in system design to restrict and control access to individual products and control networks. Refer to  http://www.ab.com/networks/architectures.html  for comprehensive information about implementing validated architectures designed to deliver these measures.\n  *  Restrict physical and electronic access to automation products, networks, and systems to only those individuals authorized to be in contact with control system equipment.\n  *  Employ firewalls with ingress/egress filtering, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and validate all configurations. Evaluate firewall configurations to ensure other appropriate inbound and outbound traffic is blocked.\n  *  Use up-to-date end-point protection software (e.g., antivirus/antimalware software) on all PC-based assets.\n  *  Make sure that software and control system device firmware is patched to current releases.\n  *  Periodically change passwords in control system components and infrastructure devices.\n  *  Where applicable, set the controller key-switch/mode-switch to RUN mode.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on security with Rockwell Automation products, please refer to  Rockwell’s Security Advisory Index http://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/54102 ."
