  "Updated": "2024-09-16T19:01:39.028Z",
  "Description": "The hook_node_access function in the revisioning module 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.3 for Drupal checks the permissions of the current user even when it is called to check permissions of other users, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions, as demonstrated when using the XML sitemap module to obtain sensitive information about unpublished content.",
