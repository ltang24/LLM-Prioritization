  "Updated": "2024-08-06T19:42:31.745Z",
  "Description": "Multiple integer overflows in the (1) malloc and (2) calloc functions in Hoard before 3.9 make it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows on implementing code via a large size value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected.",
