  "Updated": "2024-08-07T05:13:25.573Z",
  "Description": "The https web interfaces on the ATEN KH1516i IP KVM switch with firmware 1.0.063, the KN9116 IP KVM switch with firmware 1.1.104, and the PN9108 power-control unit have a hardcoded SSL private key, which makes it easier for remote attackers to decrypt https sessions by extracting this key from their own switch and then sniffing network traffic to a switch owned by a different customer.",
