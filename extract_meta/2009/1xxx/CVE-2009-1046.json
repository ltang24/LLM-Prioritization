  "Updated": "2024-08-07T04:57:17.563Z",
  "Description": "The console selection feature in the Linux kernel 2.6.28 before 2.6.28.4, 2.6.25, and possibly earlier versions, when the UTF-8 console is used, allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) by selecting a small number of 3-byte UTF-8 characters, which triggers an \"off-by-two memory error.\" NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries.",
