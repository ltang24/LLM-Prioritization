  "Published": "2009-03-03T16:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-07T04:48:51.920Z",
  "Description": "The originates_from_local_legacy_unicast_socket function in avahi-core/server.c in avahi-daemon 0.6.23 does not account for the network byte order of a port number when processing incoming multicast packets, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (network bandwidth and CPU consumption) via a crafted legacy unicast mDNS query packet that triggers a multicast packet storm.",
