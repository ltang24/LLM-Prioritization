  "Description": "The libike library, as used by in.iked, elfsign, and kcfd in Sun Solaris 9 and 10, when using an RSA key with exponent 3, removes PKCS-1 padding before generating a hash, which allows remote attackers to forge a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature that is signed by that RSA key and prevents libike from correctly verifying X.509 and other certificates that use PKCS #1, a similar issue to CVE-2006-4339.",
