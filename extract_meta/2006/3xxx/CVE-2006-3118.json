  "Published": "2006-06-30T19:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-07T18:16:05.933Z",
  "Description": "spread uses a temporary file with a static filename based on the port number, which allows local users to cause a denial of service by creating the file during a race condition between unlink and bind function calls.  NOTE: spread deletes this temporary file before use, which could cause conflicts with other programs that use the same filename, but this is not a distinct issue.",
