  "Updated": "2024-08-07T20:50:05.710Z",
  "Description": "3proxy 0.5 to 0.5.2 does not offer NTLM authentication before basic authentication, which might cause browsers with incomplete RFC2616/RFC2617 support to use basic cleartext authentication even if NTLM is available, which makes it easier for attackers to steal credentials.",
