  "CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3882",
  "Published": "2019-04-24T15:23:10",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T19:19:18.633Z",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vfio interface implementation that permits violation of the user's locked memory limit. If a device is bound to a vfio driver, such as vfio-pci, and the local attacker is administratively granted ownership of the device, it may cause a system memory exhaustion and thus a denial of service (DoS). Versions 3.10, 4.14 and 4.18 are vulnerable.",
