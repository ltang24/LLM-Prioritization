  "CVE Code": "CVE-2019-3557",
  "Published": "2019-01-15T22:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T19:12:09.545Z",
  "Description": "The implementations of streams for bz2 and php://output improperly implemented their readImpl functions, returning -1 consistently. This behavior caused some stream functions, such as stream_get_line, to trigger an out-of-bounds read when operating on such malformed streams. The implementations were updated to return valid values consistently. This affects all supported versions of HHVM (3.30 and 3.27.4 and below).",
