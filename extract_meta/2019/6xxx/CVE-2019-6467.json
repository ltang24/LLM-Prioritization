  "CVE Code": "CVE-2019-6467",
  "Published": "2019-10-09T14:17:14.449734Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-17T00:11:15.675Z",
  "Description": "A programming error in the nxdomain-redirect feature can cause an assertion failure in query.c if the alternate namespace used by nxdomain-redirect is a descendant of a zone that is served locally. The most likely scenario where this might occur is if the server, in addition to performing NXDOMAIN redirection for recursive clients, is also serving a local copy of the root zone or using mirroring to provide the root zone, although other configurations are also possible. Versions affected: BIND 9.12.0-> 9.12.4, 9.14.0. Also affects all releases in the 9.13 development branch.",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "An attacker who can deliberately trigger the condition on a server with a vulnerable configuration can cause BIND to exit, denying service to other clients."
