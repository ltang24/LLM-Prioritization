  "CVE Code": "CVE-2019-6474",
  "Published": "2019-10-16T17:22:16.767968Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-16T22:19:36.160Z",
  "Description": "A missing check on incoming client requests can be exploited to cause a situation where the Kea server's lease storage contains leases which are rejected as invalid when the server tries to load leases from storage on restart. If the number of such leases exceeds a hard-coded limit in the Kea code, a server trying to restart will conclude that there is a problem with its lease store and give up. Versions affected: 1.4.0 to 1.5.0, 1.6.0-beta1, and 1.6.0-beta2",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "Only Kea servers which use memfile storage for leases are affected by this vulnerability.  An attacker can exploit the missing check to deliberately create a situation where the server will not restart properly should it stop for any reason."
