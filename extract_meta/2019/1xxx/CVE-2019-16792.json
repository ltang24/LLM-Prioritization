  "CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16792",
  "Published": "2020-01-22T18:30:15",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T01:24:48.422Z",
  "Description": "Waitress through version 1.3.1 allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.",
