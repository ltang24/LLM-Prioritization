The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation of the HTTP URL used to establish a connection to the LSC Certificate Authority (CA). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and configuring a LSC certificate. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition due to an unexpected restart of the device.",
