  "Description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists when affected Microsoft browsers improperly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user\u2019s system.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, in a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit the vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action. For example, an attacker could trick a user into clicking a link that takes the user to the attacker's site.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft browsers handle objects in memory.",
