  "Published": "2019-09-02T22:03:34",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T01:03:30.919Z",
  "Description": "The POWER9 backend in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) before version 10 could optimize multiple calls of the __builtin_darn intrinsic into a single call, thus reducing the entropy of the random number generator. This occurred because a volatile operation was not specified. For example, within a single execution of a program, the output of every __builtin_darn() call may be the same.",
