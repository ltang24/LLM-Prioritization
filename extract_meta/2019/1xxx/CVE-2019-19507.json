  "Description": "In jpv (aka Json Pattern Validator) before 2.1.1, compareCommon() can be bypassed because certain internal attributes can be overwritten via a conflicting name, as demonstrated by 'constructor': {'name':'Array'}. This affects validate(). Hence, a crafted payload can overwrite this builtin attribute to manipulate the type detection result.",
