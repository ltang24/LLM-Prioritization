  "CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12210",
  "Published": "2019-06-04T20:28:51",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T23:17:38.208Z",
  "Description": "In Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7, when configured with debug and a custom debug log file is set using debug_file, that file descriptor is not closed when a new process is spawned. This leads to the file descriptor being inherited into the child process; the child process can then read from and write to it. This can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation.",
