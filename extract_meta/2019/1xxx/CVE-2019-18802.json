  "Updated": "2024-08-05T02:02:39.625Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Envoy 1.12.0. An untrusted remote client may send an HTTP header (such as Host) with whitespace after the header content. Envoy will treat \"header-value \" as a different string from \"header-value\" so for example with the Host header \"example.com \" one could bypass \"example.com\" matchers.",
