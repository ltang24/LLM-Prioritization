  "CVE Code": "CVE-2019-12083",
  "Published": "2019-05-13T19:06:01",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T23:10:30.191Z",
  "Description": "The Rust Programming Language Standard Library 1.34.x before 1.34.2 contains a stabilized method which, if overridden, can violate Rust's safety guarantees and cause memory unsafety. If the `Error::type_id` method is overridden then any type can be safely cast to any other type, causing memory safety vulnerabilities in safe code (e.g., out-of-bounds write or read). Code that does not manually implement Error::type_id is unaffected.",
