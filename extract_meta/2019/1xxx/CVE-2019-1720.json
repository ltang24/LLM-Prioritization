The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the XML input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specifically crafted XML payload. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust CPU resources, resulting in a DoS condition until the system is manually rebooted. Software versions prior to X12.5.1 are affected.",
