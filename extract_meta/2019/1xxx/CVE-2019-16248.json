  "CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16248",
  "Published": "2019-09-11T22:19:49",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T01:10:41.671Z",
  "Description": "The \"delete for\" feature in Telegram before 5.11 on Android does not delete shared media files from the Telegram Images directory. In other words, there is a potentially misleading UI indication that a sender can remove a recipient's copy of a previously sent image (analogous to supported functionality in which a sender can remove a recipient's copy of a previously sent message).",
