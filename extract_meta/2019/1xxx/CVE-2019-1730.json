  "Description": "A vulnerability in the Bash shell implementation for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to bypass the limited command set of the restricted Guest Shell and execute commands at the privilege level of a network-admin user outside of the Guest Shell. The attacker must authenticate with valid administrator device credentials. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect implementation of a CLI command that allows a Bash command to be incorrectly invoked on the Guest Shell CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering a crafted command at the Guest Shell prompt. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to issue commands that should be restricted by a Guest Shell account.",
