  "Published": "2019-05-28T02:05:20",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T23:17:40.038Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: this is disputed because new_ra is never used if it is NULL",
