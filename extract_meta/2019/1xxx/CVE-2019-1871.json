  "Description": "A vulnerability in the Import Cisco IMC configuration utility of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition and implement arbitrary commands with root privileges on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper bounds checking by the import-config process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to implement arbitrary code on the affected device with elevated privileges.",
