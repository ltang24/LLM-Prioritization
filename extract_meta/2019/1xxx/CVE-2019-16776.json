  "CVE Code": "CVE-2019-16776",
  "Published": "2019-12-13T00:55:16",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T01:24:48.040Z",
  "Description": "Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write. It fails to prevent access to folders outside of the intended node_modules folder through the bin field. A properly constructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a package publisher to modify and/or gain access to arbitrary files on a user's system when the package is installed. This behavior is still possible through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.",
