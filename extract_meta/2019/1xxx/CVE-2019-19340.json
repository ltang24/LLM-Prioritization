  "Updated": "2024-08-05T02:16:46.967Z",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in Ansible Tower, versions 3.6.x before 3.6.2 and 3.5.x before 3.5.3, where enabling RabbitMQ manager by setting it with '-e rabbitmq_enable_manager=true' exposes the RabbitMQ management interface publicly, as expected. If the default admin user is still active, an attacker could guess the password and gain access to the system.",
