  "CVE Code": "CVE-2019-17185",
  "Published": "2020-03-21T00:13:05",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T01:33:17.262Z",
  "Description": "In FreeRADIUS 3.0.x before 3.0.20, the EAP-pwd module used a global OpenSSL BN_CTX instance to handle all handshakes. This mean multiple threads use the same BN_CTX instance concurrently, resulting in crashes when concurrent EAP-pwd handshakes are initiated. This can be abused by an adversary as a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.",
