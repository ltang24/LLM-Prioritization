Note that the denial of service would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate the attacker's user rights.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to obtain a dial-in link for a vulnerable server and then initiates a series of calls within a short amount of time.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Skype for Business server handles objects in memory.",
