  "Published": "2019-07-02T21:17:53",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T23:41:10.490Z",
  "Description": "verification.py in django-rest-registration (aka Django REST Registration library) before 0.5.0 relies on a static string for signatures (i.e., the Django Signing API is misused), which allows remote attackers to spoof the verification process. This occurs because incorrect code refactoring led to calling a security-critical function with an incorrect argument.",
