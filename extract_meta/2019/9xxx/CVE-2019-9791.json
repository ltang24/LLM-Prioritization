  "CVE Code": "CVE-2019-9791",
  "Published": "2019-04-26T16:13:22",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T22:01:54.733Z",
  "Description": "The type inference system allows the compilation of functions that can cause type confusions between arbitrary objects when compiled through the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler and when the constructor function is entered through on-stack replacement (OSR). This allows for possible arbitrary reading and writing of objects during an exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.6, Firefox ESR < 60.6, and Firefox < 66.",
