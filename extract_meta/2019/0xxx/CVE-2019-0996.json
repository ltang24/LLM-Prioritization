  "Description": "A spoofing vulnerability exists in Azure DevOps Server when it improperly handles requests to authorize applications, resulting in a cross-site request forgery. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass OAuth protections and register an application on behalf of the targeted user.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a page specifically designed to cause a cross-site request. The attacker would then need to convince a targeted user to click a link to the malicious page.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Azure DevOps Server protects application registration requests.",
