  "Published": "2019-07-31T16:51:28",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T19:47:55.654Z",
  "Description": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XPM image rendering function of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XPM image can cause an integer overflow in the colorhash function, allocating too small of a buffer. This buffer can then be written out of bounds, resulting in a heap overflow, ultimately ending in code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.",
