  "Published": "2023-10-31T00:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-09-06T18:28:17.077Z",
  "Description": "JHipster generator-jhipster before 2.23.0 allows a timing attack against validateToken due to a string comparison that stops at the first character that is different. Attackers can guess tokens by brute forcing one character at a time and observing the timing. This of course drastically reduces the search space to a linear amount of guesses based on the token length times the possible characters.",
