  "Description": "The remote-support feature on Cisco Web Security Virtual Appliance (WSAv), Email Security Virtual Appliance (ESAv), and Security Management Virtual Appliance (SMAv) devices before 2015-06-25 uses the same default SSH root authorized key across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication by leveraging knowledge of a private key from another installation, aka Bug IDs CSCuu95988, CSCuu95994, and CSCuu96630.",
