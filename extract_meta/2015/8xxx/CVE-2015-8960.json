  "CVE Code": "CVE-2015-8960",
  "Published": "2016-09-21T01:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-06T08:36:30.681Z",
  "Description": "The TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier supports the rsa_fixed_dh, dss_fixed_dh, rsa_fixed_ecdh, and ecdsa_fixed_ecdh values for ClientCertificateType but does not directly document the ability to compute the master secret in certain situations with a client secret key and server public key but not a server secret key, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof TLS servers by leveraging knowledge of the secret key for an arbitrary installed client X.509 certificate, aka the \"Key Compromise Impersonation (KCI)\" issue.",
