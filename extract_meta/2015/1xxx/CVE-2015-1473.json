  "CVE Code": "CVE-2015-1473",
  "Published": "2015-04-08T10:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-06T04:47:16.189Z",
  "Description": "The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.21 does not properly consider data-type size during a risk-management decision for use of the alloca function, which might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation violation) or overwrite memory locations beyond the stack boundary via a long line containing wide characters that are improperly handled in a wscanf call.",
