  "CVE Code": "CVE-2016-4298",
  "Published": "2017-01-06T21:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-06T00:25:14.120Z",
  "Description": "When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will attempt to allocate space for a list of elements using a length from the file. When calculating this length, an integer overflow can be made to occur which will cause the buffer to be undersized when the application tries to copy file data into the object containing this structure. This allows one to overwrite contiguous data in the heap which can lead to code-execution under the context of the application.",
