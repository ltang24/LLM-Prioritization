  "Updated": "2024-08-06T00:25:14.450Z",
  "Description": "Multiple information leaks exist in various IOCTL handlers of the Kaspersky Internet Security KLDISK driver. Specially crafted IOCTL requests can cause the driver to return out-of-bounds kernel memory, potentially leaking sensitive information such as privileged tokens or kernel memory addresses that may be useful in bypassing kernel mitigations. An unprivileged user can run a program from user-mode to trigger this vulnerability.",
