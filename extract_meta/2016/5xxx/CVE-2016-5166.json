  "Published": "2016-09-11T10:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-06T00:53:48.232Z",
  "Description": "The download implementation in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux does not properly restrict saving a file:// URL that is referenced by an http:// URL, which makes it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to discover NetNTLM hashes and conduct SMB relay attacks via a crafted web page that is accessed with the \"Save page as\" menu choice.",
