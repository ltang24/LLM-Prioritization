  "Published": "2018-05-31T20:00:00Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-16T20:37:56.998Z",
  "Description": "A common setup to deploy to gh-pages on every commit via a CI system is to expose a github token to ENV and to use it directly in the auth part of the url. In module versions < 0.9.1 the auth portion of the url is outputted as part of the grunt tasks logging function. If this output is publicly available then the credentials should be considered compromised.",
