  "Description": "Add-on updates failed to verify that the add-on ID inside the signed package matched the ID of the add-on being updated. An attacker who could perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the user's connection to the update server and defeat the certificate pinning protection could provide a malicious signed add-on instead of a valid update. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 45.5 and Firefox < 50.",
