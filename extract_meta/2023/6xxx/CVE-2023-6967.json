  "Description": "The Pods \u2013 Custom Content Types and Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.10 (with the exception of 2.7.31.2, 2.8.23.2, 2.9.19.2) due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor level access or higher, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",
