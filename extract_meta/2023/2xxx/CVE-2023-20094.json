An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read that discloses sensitive information.\r\nNote: This vulnerability only affects Cisco Webex Desk Hub.\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
