  "Description": "A vulnerability in the endpoint software of Cisco Secure Endpoint for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to evade endpoint protection within a limited time window. This vulnerability is due to a timing issue that occurs between various software components. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to put a malicious file into a specific folder and then persuading the user to execute the file within a limited time window. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the endpoint software to fail to quarantine the malicious file or kill its process. Note: This vulnerability only applies to deployments that have the Windows Folder Redirection feature enabled.",
