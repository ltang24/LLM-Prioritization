  "Description": "redis-py before 4.4.4 and 4.5.x before 4.5.4 leaves a connection open after canceling an async Redis command at an inopportune time, and can send response data to the client of an unrelated request. (This could, for example, happen for a non-pipeline operation.) NOTE: the solutions for CVE-2023-28859 address data leakage across AsyncIO connections in general.",
