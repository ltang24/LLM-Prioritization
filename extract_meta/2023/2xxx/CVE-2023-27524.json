  "Updated": "2025-07-30T01:37:26.652Z",
  "Description": "Session Validation attacks in Apache Superset versions up to and including 2.0.1. Installations that have not altered the default configured SECRET_KEY according to installation instructions allow for an attacker to authenticate and access unauthorized resources. This does not affect Superset administrators who have changed the default value for SECRET_KEY config.\n\nAll superset installations should always set a unique secure random SECRET_KEY. Your SECRET_KEY is used to securely sign all session cookies and encrypting sensitive information on the database.\nAdd a strong SECRET_KEY to your `superset_config.py` file like:\n\nSECRET_KEY = <YOUR_OWN_RANDOM_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY>\n\nAlternatively you can set it with `SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.\n",
