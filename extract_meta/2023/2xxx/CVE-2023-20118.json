  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business Routers RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user input within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root-level privileges and access unauthorized data. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials on the affected device.\r\n\r Cisco has not and will not release software updates that address this vulnerability.   However, administrators may disable the affected feature as described in the Workarounds [\"#workarounds\"] section.\r\n\r  {{value}} [\"%7b%7bvalue%7d%7d\"])}]]",
