  "Updated": "2024-09-18T18:29:11.073Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Technitium 11.0.2. There is a vulnerability (called BadDNS) in DNS resolving software, which triggers a resolver to ignore valid responses, thus causing DoS (denial of service) for normal resolution. The effects of an exploit would be widespread and highly impactful, because the attacker could just forge a response targeting the source port of a vulnerable resolver without the need to guess the correct TXID.",
