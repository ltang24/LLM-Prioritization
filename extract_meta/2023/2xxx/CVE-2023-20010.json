  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface inadequately validates user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as a low-privileged user and sending crafted SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or modify any data on the underlying database or elevate their privileges.",
