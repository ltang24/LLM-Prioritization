  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Tigergraph Enterprise 3.7.0. The GSQL query language provides users with the ability to write data to files on a remote TigerGraph server. The locations that a query is allowed to write to are configurable via the GSQL.FileOutputPolicy configuration setting. GSQL queries that contain UDFs can bypass this configuration setting and, as a consequence, can write to any file location to which the administrative user has access.",
