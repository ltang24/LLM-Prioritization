If non-default HTTP       connector settings were used such that the maxParameterCount\u00a0could be reached using query string parameters and a request was       submitted that supplied exactly maxParameterCount parameters\u00a0in the query string, the limit for uploaded request parts could be\u00a0bypassed with the potential for a denial of service to occur.",
