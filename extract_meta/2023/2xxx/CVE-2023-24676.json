  "Published": "2024-01-24T00:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-02T11:03:18.818Z",
  "Description": "An issue found in ProcessWire 3.0.210 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code and install a reverse shell via the download_zip_url parameter when installing a new module. NOTE: this is disputed because exploitation requires that the attacker is able to enter requests as an admin; however, a ProcessWire admin is intentionally allowed to install any module that contains any arbitrary code.",
