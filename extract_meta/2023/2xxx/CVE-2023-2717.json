  "Description": "The Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.7.9.8. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'enable_safe_mode' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable safe mode, which disables all other plugins, via a forged request if they can successfully trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. A warning message about safe mode is displayed to the admin, which can be easily disabled.",
