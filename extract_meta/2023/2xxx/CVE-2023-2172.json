This is due to improper validation and authorization checks within the badgeos_update_steps_ajax_handler, badgeos_update_award_steps_ajax_handler, badgeos_update_deduct_steps_ajax_handler, and badgeos_update_ranks_req_steps_ajax_handler functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to overwrite arbitrary post titles.",
