  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Opsview Monitor Agent 6.8. An unauthenticated remote attacker can call check_nrpe against affected targets, specifying known NRPE plugins, which in default installations are configured to accept command control characters and pass them to command-line interpreters for NRPE plugin execution. This allows the attacker to escape NRPE plugin execution and execute commands remotely on the target as NT_AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.",
