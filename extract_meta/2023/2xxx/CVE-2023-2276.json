  "Description": "The WCFM Membership \u2013 WooCommerce Memberships for Multivendor Marketplace plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References in versions up to, and including, 2.10.7. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.",
