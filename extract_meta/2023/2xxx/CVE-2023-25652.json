  "Updated": "2025-02-13T16:44:34.732Z",
  "Description": "Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.30.9, 2.31.8, 2.32.7, 2.33.8, 2.34.8, 2.35.8, 2.36.6, 2.37.7, 2.38.5, 2.39.3, and 2.40.1, by feeding specially crafted input to `git apply --reject`, a path outside the working tree can be overwritten with partially controlled contents (corresponding to the rejected hunk(s) from the given patch). A fix is available in versions 2.30.9, 2.31.8, 2.32.7, 2.33.8, 2.34.8, 2.35.8, 2.36.6, 2.37.7, 2.38.5, 2.39.3, and 2.40.1. As a workaround, avoid using `git apply` with `--reject` when applying patches from an untrusted source. Use `git apply --stat` to inspect a patch before applying; avoid applying one that create a conflict where a link corresponding to the `*.rej` file exists.",
