  "Description": "\nIn Apache Linkis <=1.3.1,\u00a0due to the default token generated by Linkis Gateway deployment being too simple, it is easy for attackers to obtain the default token for the attack.\u00a0Generation rules should add random values.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend users upgrade the version of Linkis to version 1.3.2 And modify the default token value. You can refer to Token authorization[1]\n https://linkis.apache.org/docs/latest/auth/token https://linkis.apache.org/docs/latest/auth/token \n\n\n\n\n",
