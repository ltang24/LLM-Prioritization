  "Published": "2023-08-02T19:52:48.613Z",
  "Updated": "2025-02-13T16:49:15.755Z",
  "Description": "The TIFF decoder does not place a limit on the size of compressed tile data. A maliciously-crafted image can exploit this to cause a small image (both in terms of pixel width/height, and encoded size) to make the decoder decode large amounts of compressed data, consuming excessive memory and CPU.",

    "CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
