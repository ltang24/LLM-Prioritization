  "Description": "There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS\u00a0or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP\u00a0has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege.\n\nThere is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data\u00a0of a struct inet_connection_sock.\n\nWhen CONFIG_TLS\u00a0is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable.\n\nThe setsockopt\u00a0TCP_ULP\u00a0operation does not require any privilege.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit\u00a02c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c",
