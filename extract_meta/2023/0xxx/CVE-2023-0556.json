  "Updated": "2025-01-13T17:09:55.039Z",
  "Description": "The ContentStudio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several functions in versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain the blog metadata (via the function cstu_get_metadata) that includes the plugin's contentstudio_token. Knowing this token allows for other interactions with the plugin such as creating posts in versions prior to 1.2.5, which added other requirements to posting and updating.",
