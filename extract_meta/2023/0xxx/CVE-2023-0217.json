  "Updated": "2025-05-05T16:09:30.988Z",
  "Description": "An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an\napplication tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the\nEVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead\nto an application crash. This function can be called on public\nkeys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker\nto cause a denial of service attack.\n\nThe TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function\nbut applications might call the function if there are additional\nsecurity requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.",
