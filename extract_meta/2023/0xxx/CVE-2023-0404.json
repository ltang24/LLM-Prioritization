  "Updated": "2025-01-13T17:11:09.004Z",
  "Description": "The Events Made Easy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several functions related to AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 2.3.16. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to invoke those functions intended for administrator use. While the plugin is still pending review from the WordPress repository, site owners can download a copy of the patched version directly from the developer's Github at https://github.com/liedekef/events-made-easy",
