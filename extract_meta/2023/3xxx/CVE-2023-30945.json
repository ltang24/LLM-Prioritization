  "Updated": "2024-12-05T14:30:12.082Z",
  "Description": "Multiple Services such as VHS(Video History Server) and VCD(Video Clip Distributor) and Clips2 were discovered to be vulnerable to an unauthenticated arbitrary file read/write vulnerability due to missing input validation on filenames. A malicious attacker could read sensitive files from the filesystem or write/delete arbitrary files on the filesystem as well.",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.",
    "The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory."
