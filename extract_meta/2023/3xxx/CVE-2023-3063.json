  "Description": "The SP Project & Document Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References in versions up to, and including, 4.67.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber privileges or above, to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.",
