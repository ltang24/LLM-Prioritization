  "CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31421",
  "Published": "2023-10-26T03:10:52.684Z",
  "Updated": "2024-08-02T14:53:30.714Z",
  "Description": "It was discovered that when acting as TLS clients, Beats, Elastic Agent, APM Server, and Fleet Server did not verify whether the server certificate is valid for the target IP address; however, certificate signature validation is still performed. More specifically, when the client is configured to connect to an IP address (instead of a hostname) it does not validate the server certificate's IP SAN values against that IP address and certificate validation fails, and therefore the connection is not blocked as expected.",
