  "Updated": "2025-01-30T20:25:37.785Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in ebankIT before 7. A Denial-of-Service attack is possible through the GET parameter EStatementsIds located on the /Controls/Generic/EBMK/Handlers/EStatements/DownloadEStatement.ashx endpoint. The GET parameter accepts over 100 comma-separated e-statement IDs without throwing an error. When this many IDs are supplied, the server takes around 60 seconds to respond and successfully generate the expected ZIP archive (during this time period, no other pages load). A threat actor could issue a request to this endpoint with 100+ statement IDs every 30 seconds, potentially resulting in an overload of the server for all users.",
