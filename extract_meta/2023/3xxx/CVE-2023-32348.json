It connects new devices in a manner that allows the new device to communicate with all Teltonika devices connected to the VPN. The OpenVPN server also allows users to route through it. An attacker could route a connection to a remote server through the OpenVPN server, enabling them to scan and access data from other Teltonika devices connected to the VPN.\n\n",
