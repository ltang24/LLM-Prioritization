  "Description": "RemoteClinic 2.0 contains a critical vulnerability chain that can be exploited by a remote attacker with low-privileged user credentials to create admin users, escalate privileges, and execute arbitrary code on the target system via a PHP shell. The vulnerabilities are caused by a lack of input validation and access control in the staff/register.php endpoint and the edit-my-profile.php page. By sending a series of specially crafted requests to the RemoteClinic application, an attacker can create admin users with more privileges than their own, upload a PHP file containing arbitrary code, and execute arbitrary commands via the PHP shell.",
