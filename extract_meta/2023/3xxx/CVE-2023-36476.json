  "Description": "calamares-nixos-extensions provides Calamares branding and modules for NixOS, a distribution of GNU/Linux. Users of calamares-nixos-extensions version 0.3.12 and prior who installed NixOS through the graphical calamares installer, with an unencrypted `/boot`, on either non-UEFI systems or with a LUKS partition different from `/` have their LUKS key file in `/boot` as a plaintext CPIO archive attached to their NixOS initrd. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of version 0.3.13 to backport to NixOS 22.11, 23.05, and unstable channels. Expert users who have a copy of their data may, as a workaround, re-encrypt the LUKS partition(s) themselves.",
