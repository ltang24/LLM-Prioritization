  "Updated": "2024-09-15T19:57:13.528Z",
  "Description": "The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018customTag' attribute in versions up to, and including, 1.10.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the Bricks Builder (admin-only by default), to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This becomes more of an issue when Bricks Builder access is granted to lower-privileged users.",
