  "Description": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn spring AMQP versions 1.0.0 to\n2.4.16 and 3.0.0 to 3.0.9 , allowed list patterns for deserializable class\nnames were added to Spring AMQP, allowing users to lock down deserialization of\ndata in messages from untrusted sources; however by default, when no allowed\nlist was provided, all classes could be deserialized.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, an application is\nvulnerable if\n\n\n\n\n   *  the\n     SimpleMessageConverter or SerializerMessageConverter is used\n\n   *  the user\n     does not configure allowed list patterns\n\n   *  untrusted\n     message originators gain permissions to write messages to the RabbitMQ\n     broker to send malicious content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
