  "Published": "2023-05-24T00:00:00",
  "Updated": "2025-01-16T15:48:49.894Z",
  "Description": "Bramble Handshake Protocol (BHP) in Briar before 1.5.3 is not forward secure: eavesdroppers can decrypt network traffic between two accounts if they later compromise both accounts. NOTE: the eavesdropping is typically impractical because BHP runs over an encrypted session that uses the Tor hidden service protocol.",
