  "CVE Code": "CVE-2023-3181",
  "Published": "2024-01-25T15:22:47.828Z",
  "Updated": "2025-06-03T18:21:59.225Z",
  "Description": "The C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Splashtop\\Splashtop Software Updater\\uninst.exe process creates a folder at C:\\Windows\\Temp~nsu.tmp and copies itself to it as Au_.exe. The C:\\Windows\\Temp~nsu.tmp\\Au_.exe file is automatically launched as SYSTEM when the system reboots or when a standard user runs an MSI repair using Splashtop Streamer\u2019s Windows Installer. Since the C:\\Windows\\Temp~nsu.tmp folder inherits permissions from C:\\Windows\\Temp and Au_.exe is susceptible to DLL hijacking, standard users can write a malicious DLL to it and elevate their privileges.",
