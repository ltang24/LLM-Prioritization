  "Description": "A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the file system integrity.\n\n\n\nWith a specific request to user.php that doesn't require authentication an attacker is able to upload arbitrary files via J-Web, leading to a loss of \n\nintegrity\n\nfor a certain\u00a0\n\npart of the\u00a0file system, which may allow chaining to other vulnerabilities.\n\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions prior to 20.4R3-S8;\n  *  21.1 versions 21.1R1 and later;\n  *  21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S6;\n  *  21.3 versions \n\nprior to \n\n 21.3R3-S5;\n  *  21.4 versions \n\nprior to \n\n21.4R3-S5;\n  *  22.1 versions \n\nprior to \n\n22.1R3-S3;\n  *  22.2 versions \n\nprior to \n\n22.2R3-S2;\n  *  22.3 versions \n\nprior to \n\n22.3R2-S2, 22.3R3;\n  *  22.4 versions \n\nprior to \n\n22.4R2-S1, 22.4R3.\n\n\n\n\n",
