  "Description": "The Lana Text to Image plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'lana_text_to_image' and 'lana_text_to_img' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
