  "Description": "jackson-databind through 2.15.2 allows attackers to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact via a crafted object that uses cyclic dependencies. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that this is not a valid vulnerability report, because the steps of constructing a cyclic data structure and trying to serialize it cannot be achieved by an external attacker.",
