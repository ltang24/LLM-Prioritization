  "Description": "Armeria is a microservice framework Spring supports Matrix variables. When Spring integration is used, Armeria calls Spring controllers via `TomcatService` or `JettyService` with the path that may contain matrix variables. Prior to version 1.24.3, the Armeria decorators might not invoked because of the matrix variables. If an attacker sends a specially crafted request, the request may bypass the authorizer. Version 1.24.3 contains a patch for this issue.",
