  "CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38408",
  "Published": "2023-07-20T00:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-10-15T18:33:21.591Z",
  "Description": "The PKCS#11 feature in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.3p2 has an insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system. (Code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent.) NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-10009.",
