  "Updated": "2025-02-05T19:38:58.410Z",
  "Description": "The Essential Addons For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated API key disclosure in versions up to, and including, 5.8.1 due to the plugin adding the API key to the source code of any page running the MailChimp block. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain a site's MailChimp API key. We recommend resetting any MailChimp API keys if running a vulnerable version of this plugin with the MailChimp block enabled as the API key may have been compromised. This only affects sites running the premium version of the plugin and that have the Mailchimp block enabled on a page.",
