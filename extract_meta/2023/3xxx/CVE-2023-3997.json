  "Description": "Splunk SOAR versions lower than 6.1.0 are indirectly affected by a potential vulnerability accessed through the user\u2019s terminal. A third party can send Splunk SOAR a maliciously crafted web request containing special ANSI characters to cause log file poisoning. When a terminal user attempts to view the poisoned logs, this can tamper with the terminal and cause possible malicious code execution from the terminal user\u2019s action.",

    "The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes output that is written to logs."
