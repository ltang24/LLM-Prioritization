  "Updated": "2025-02-13T17:02:53.427Z",
  "Description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions of FreeRDP are subject to a Null Pointer Dereference leading a crash in the RemoteFX (rfx) handling.  Inside the `rfx_process_message_tileset` function, the program allocates tiles using `rfx_allocate_tiles` for the number of numTiles. If the initialization process of tiles is not completed for various reasons, tiles will have a NULL pointer. Which may be accessed in further processing and would cause a program crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
