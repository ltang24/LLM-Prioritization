  "Description": "Cross site request forgery in Kiteworks OwnCloud allows an unauthenticated attacker to forge requests.\nIf a request has no Authorization header, it is created with an empty string as value by a rewrite rule. The CSRF check is done by comparing the header value to null, meaning that the existing CSRF check is bypassed in this case. An attacker can, for example, create a new administrator account if the request is executed in the browser of an authenticated victim.",
