  "CVE Code": "CVE-2023-50387",
  "Published": "2024-02-14T00:00:00.000Z",
  "Updated": "2025-05-12T15:02:17.822Z",
  "Description": "Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035, 6840, and related RFCs) allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the \"KeyTrap\" issue. One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.",
