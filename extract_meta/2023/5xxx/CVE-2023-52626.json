  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: Fix operation precedence bug in port timestamping napi_poll context\n\nIndirection (*) is of lower precedence than postfix increment (++). Logic\nin napi_poll context would cause an out-of-bound read by first increment\nthe pointer address by byte address space and then dereference the value.\nRather, the intended logic was to dereference first and then increment the\nunderlying value.",
