  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: SOF: amd: Fix memory leak in amd_sof_acp_probe()\n\nDriver uses kasprintf() to initialize fw_{code,data}_bin members of\nstruct acp_dev_data, but kfree() is never called to deallocate the\nmemory, which results in a memory leak.\n\nFix the issue by switching to devm_kasprintf(). Additionally, ensure the\nallocation was successful by checking the pointer validity.",
