  "Description": "Before correction, the\u00a0copy_file_range\u00a0system call checked only for the CAP_READ and CAP_WRITE capabilities on the input and output file descriptors, respectively.  Using an offset is logically equivalent to seeking, and the system call must additionally require the CAP_SEEK capability.\n\nThis incorrect privilege check enabled sandboxed processes with only read or write but no seek capability on a file descriptor to read data from or write data to an arbitrary location within the file corresponding to that file descriptor.",
