  "Description": "php-svg-lib is an SVG file parsing / rendering library. Prior to version 0.5.1, when handling `<use>` tag that references an `<image>` tag, it merges the attributes from the `<use>` tag to the `<image>` tag. The problem pops up especially when the `href` attribute from the `<use>` tag has not been sanitized. This can lead to an unsafe file read that can cause PHAR Deserialization vulnerability in PHP prior to version 8. Version 0.5.1 contains a patch for this issue. ",
