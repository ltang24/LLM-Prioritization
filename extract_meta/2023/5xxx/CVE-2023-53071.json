  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mt76: do not run mt76_unregister_device() on unregistered hw\n\nTrying to probe a mt7921e pci card without firmware results in a\nsuccessful probe where ieee80211_register_hw hasn't been called. When\nremoving the driver, ieee802111_unregister_hw is called unconditionally\nleading to a kernel NULL pointer dereference.\nFix the issue running mt76_unregister_device routine just for registered\nhw.",
