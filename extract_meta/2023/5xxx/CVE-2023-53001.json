  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/drm_vma_manager: Add drm_vma_node_allow_once()\n\nCurrently there is no easy way for a drm driver to safely check and allow\ndrm_vma_offset_node for a drm file just once. Allow drm drivers to call\nnon-refcounted version of drm_vma_node_allow() so that a driver doesn't\nneed to keep track of each drm_vma_node_allow() to call subsequent\ndrm_vma_node_revoke() to prevent memory leak.",
