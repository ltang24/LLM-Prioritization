  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: update s_journal_inum if it changes after journal replay\n\nWhen mounting a crafted ext4 image, s_journal_inum may change after journal\nreplay, which is obviously unreasonable because we have successfully loaded\nand replayed the journal through the old s_journal_inum. And the new\ns_journal_inum bypasses some of the checks in ext4_get_journal(), which\nmay trigger a null pointer dereference problem. So if s_journal_inum\nchanges after the journal replay, we ignore the change, and rewrite the\ncurrent journal_inum to the superblock.",
