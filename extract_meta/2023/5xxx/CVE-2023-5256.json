With some configurations, this may cause sensitive information to be cached and made available to anonymous users, leading to privilege escalation.\n\nThis vulnerability only affects sites with the JSON:API module enabled, and can be mitigated by uninstalling JSON:API.\n\nThe core REST and contributed GraphQL modules are not affected.\n\n\n\n",
