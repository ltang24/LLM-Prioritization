  "Description": "yii2-authclient is an extension that adds OpenID, OAuth, OAuth2 and OpenId Connect consumers for the Yii framework 2.0. In yii2-authclient prior to version 2.2.15, the Oauth1/2 `state` and OpenID Connect `nonce` is vulnerable for a `timing attack` since it is compared via regular string comparison (instead of `Yii::$app->getSecurity()->compareString()`). Version 2.2.15 contains a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.",
