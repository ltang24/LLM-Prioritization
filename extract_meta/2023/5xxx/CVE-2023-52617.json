  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: switchtec: Fix stdev_release() crash after surprise hot remove\n\nA PCI device hot removal may occur while stdev->cdev is held open. The call\nto stdev_release() then happens during close or exit, at a point way past\nswitchtec_pci_remove(). Otherwise the last ref would vanish with the\ntrailing put_device(), just before return.\n\nAt that later point in time, the devm cleanup has already removed the\nstdev->mmio_mrpc mapping. Also, the stdev->pdev reference was not a counted\none. Therefore, in DMA mode, the iowrite32() in stdev_release() will cause\na fatal page fault, and the subsequent dma_free_coherent(), if reached,\nwould pass a stale &stdev->pdev->dev pointer.\n\nFix by moving MRPC DMA shutdown into switchtec_pci_remove(), after\nstdev_kill(). Counting the stdev->pdev ref is now optional, but may prevent\nfuture accidents.\n\nReproducible via the script at\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/r/20231113212150.96410-1-dns@arista.com",
