  "Description": "FileUtil.extract() enumerates all zip file entries and extracts each file without validating whether file paths in the archive are outside the intended directory.\n\nWhen creating an instance of TensorflowModel using the saved_model format and an exported tensorflow model, the apply() function invokes the vulnerable implementation of FileUtil.extract().\n\nArbitrary file creation can directly lead to code execution\n\n",
