  "Description": "Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, there is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in any API endpoints reliant on the `/<camera_name>` base path as values provided for the path are not sanitized. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. As the reflected values included in the URL are not sanitized or escaped, this permits execution arbitrary Javascript payloads. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch for this issue.",
