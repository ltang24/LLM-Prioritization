  "Description": "Concrete CMS before 8.5.13 and 9.x before 9.2.2 allows unauthorized access because directories can be created with insecure permissions.

Excessive permissions can be granted when creating a directory with permissions greater than 0755 or when the permissions argument is not specified.",
