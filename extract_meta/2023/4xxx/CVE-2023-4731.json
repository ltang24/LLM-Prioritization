  "Description": "The LadiApp plugn for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to a missing nonce check on the init_endpoint() function hooked via 'init' in versions up to, and including, 4.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify a variety of settings, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. An attacker can directly modify the 'ladipage_key' which enables them to create new posts on the website and inject malicious web scripts,",
