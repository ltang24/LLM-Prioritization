  "Updated": "2025-02-13T17:14:00.033Z",
  "Description": "Using go get to fetch a module with the \".git\" suffix may unexpectedly fallback to the insecure \"git://\" protocol if the module is unavailable via the secure \"https://\" and \"git+ssh://\" protocols, even if GOINSECURE is not set for said module. This only affects users who are not using the module proxy and are fetching modules directly (i.e. GOPROXY=off).",
