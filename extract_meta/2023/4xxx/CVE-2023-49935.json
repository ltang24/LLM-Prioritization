  "Updated": "2024-08-02T22:09:49.285Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in SchedMD Slurm 23.02.x and 23.11.x. There is Incorrect Access Control because of a slurmd Message Integrity Bypass. An attacker can reuse root-level authentication tokens during interaction with the slurmd process. This bypasses the RPC message hashes that protect against undesired MUNGE credential reuse. The fixed versions are 23.02.7 and 23.11.1.",
