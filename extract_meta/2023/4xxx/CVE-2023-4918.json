  "Published": "2023-09-12T19:24:59.955Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-25T19:53:21.639Z",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in the Keycloak package, more specifically org.keycloak.userprofile. When a user registers itself through registration flow, the \"password\" and \"password-confirm\" field from the form will occur as regular user attributes. All users and clients with proper rights and roles are able to read users attributes, allowing a malicious user with minimal access to retrieve the users passwords in clear text, jeopardizing their environment.",
