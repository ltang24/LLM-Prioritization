In affected versions the login screen of the standalone install tool discloses the full path of the transient data directory (e.g. /var/www/html/var/transient/). This applies to composer-based scenarios only - \u201cclassic\u201d non-composer installations are not affected. This issue has been addressed in version 12.4.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n",
