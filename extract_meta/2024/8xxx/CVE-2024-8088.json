  "Description": "There is a HIGH severity vulnerability affecting the CPython \"zipfile\"\nmodule affecting \"zipfile.Path\". Note that the more common API \"zipfile.ZipFile\" class is unaffected.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen iterating over names of entries in a zip archive (for example, methods\nof \"zipfile.Path\" like \"namelist()\", \"iterdir()\", etc)\nthe process can be put into an infinite loop with a maliciously crafted\nzip archive. This defect applies when reading only metadata or extracting\nthe contents of the zip archive. Programs that are not handling\nuser-controlled zip archives are not affected.",
