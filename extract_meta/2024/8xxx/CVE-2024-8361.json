  "Updated": "2025-01-08T15:54:30.844Z",
  "Description": "In SiWx91x devices, the SHA2/224 algorithm returns a hash of 256 bits instead of 224 bits. This incorrect hash length triggers a software assertion, which subsequently causes a Denial of Service (DoS).\nIf a watchdog is implemented, device will restart after watch dog expires. If watchdog is not implemented, device can be recovered only after a hard reset",
