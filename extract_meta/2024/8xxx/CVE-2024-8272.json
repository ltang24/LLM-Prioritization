  "Description": "The com.uaudio.bsd.helper\u00a0service, responsible for handling privileged operations, fails to implement critical client validation during XPC inter-process communication (IPC). Specifically, the service does not verify the code requirements, entitlements, or security flags of any client attempting to establish a connection. This lack of proper validation allows unauthorized clients to exploit the service's methods and escalate privileges to root.",
