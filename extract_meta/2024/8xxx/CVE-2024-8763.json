  "Description": "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input.",
