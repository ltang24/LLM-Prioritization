  "Updated": "2024-10-08T13:21:16.330Z",
  "Description": "The Easy Mega Menu Plugin for WordPress \u2013 ThemeHunk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018themehunk_megamenu_bg_image' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Please note that this was partially fixed in 1.1.0 due to the missing authorization protection that was added.",
