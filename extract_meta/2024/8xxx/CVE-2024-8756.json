  "Description": "The Quform - WordPress Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.20.0 via the 'saveUploadedFile' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information, from files uploaded by users. Files uploaded via forms created before version 2.21.0 will remain vulnerable to exposure after upgrading. To fully patch the plugin, site administrators should download any previously uploaded files, delete previously existing files and forms, and create the forms again after upgrading to version 2.21.0.",
