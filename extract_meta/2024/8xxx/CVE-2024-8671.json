  "Updated": "2024-09-24T15:34:14.805Z",
  "Description": "The WooEvents - Calendar and Event Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file overwrite due to insufficient file path validation in the inc/barcode.php file in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to overwrite arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).",
