  "Description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the `vorbis_handle_identification_packet` function within `gstvorbisdec.c`. The position array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If vd->vi.channels exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the position array. The value written will always be `GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE`. This vulnerability allows someone to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack. Additionally, this bug can overwrite the `GstAudioInfo` info structure. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
