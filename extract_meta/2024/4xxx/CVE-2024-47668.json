  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlib/generic-radix-tree.c: Fix rare race in __genradix_ptr_alloc()\n\nIf we need to increase the tree depth, allocate a new node, and then\nrace with another thread that increased the tree depth before us, we'll\nstill have a preallocated node that might be used later.\n\nIf we then use that node for a new non-root node, it'll still have a\npointer to the old root instead of being zeroed - fix this by zeroing it\nin the cmpxchg failure path.",
