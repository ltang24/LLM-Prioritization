  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: pm: fix ID 0 endp usage after multiple re-creations\n\n'local_addr_used' and 'add_addr_accepted' are decremented for addresses\nnot related to the initial subflow (ID0), because the source and\ndestination addresses of the initial subflows are known from the\nbeginning: they don't count as \"additional local address being used\" or\n\"ADD_ADDR being accepted\".\n\nIt is then required not to increment them when the entrypoint used by\nthe initial subflow is removed and re-added during a connection. Without\nthis modification, this entrypoint cannot be removed and re-added more\nthan once.",
