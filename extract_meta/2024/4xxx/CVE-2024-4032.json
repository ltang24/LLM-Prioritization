  "Description": "The \u201cipaddress\u201d module contained incorrect information about whether certain IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were designated as \u201cglobally reachable\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d. This affected the is_private and is_global properties of the ipaddress.IPv4Address, ipaddress.IPv4Network, ipaddress.IPv6Address, and ipaddress.IPv6Network classes, where values wouldn\u2019t be returned in accordance with the latest information from the IANA Special-Purpose Address Registries.\n\nCPython 3.12.4 and 3.13.0a6 contain updated information from these registries and thus have the intended behavior.",
