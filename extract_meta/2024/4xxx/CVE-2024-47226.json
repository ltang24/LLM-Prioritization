  "Description": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in NetBox 4.1.0 within the \"Configuration History\" feature of the \"Admin\" panel via a /core/config-revisions/ Add action. An authenticated user can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML into the \"Top banner\" field. NOTE: Multiple third parties have disputed this as not a vulnerability. It is argued that the configuration revision banner feature is meant to contain unsanitized HTML in order to display notifications to users. Since these fields are intended to display unsanitized HTML, this is working as intended.",
