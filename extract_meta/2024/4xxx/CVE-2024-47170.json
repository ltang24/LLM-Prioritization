A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.0.330 permits attackers to read arbitrary JSON files at attacker-chosen locations on the server. This issue can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and exposure of confidential configuration files. This only affects installations with `JSON_STORAGE` enabled which is intended to local/self-hosting only. Version 1.0.330 fixes this issue.",
