  "Description": "Werkzeug is a Web Server Gateway Interface web application library. On Python < 3.11 on Windows, os.path.isabs() does not catch UNC paths like //server/share. Werkzeug's safe_join() relies on this check, and so can produce a path that is not safe, potentially allowing unintended access to data. Applications using Python >= 3.11, or not using Windows, are not vulnerable. Werkzeug version 3.0.6 contains a patch.",
