  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstackdepot: fix stack_depot_save_flags() in NMI context\n\nPer documentation, stack_depot_save_flags() was meant to be usable from\nNMI context if STACK_DEPOT_FLAG_CAN_ALLOC is unset.  However, it still\nwould try to take the pool_lock in an attempt to save a stack trace in the\ncurrent pool (if space is available).\n\nThis could result in deadlock if an NMI is handled while pool_lock is\nalready held.  To avoid deadlock, only try to take the lock in NMI context\nand give up if unsuccessful.\n\nThe documentation is fixed to clearly convey this.",
