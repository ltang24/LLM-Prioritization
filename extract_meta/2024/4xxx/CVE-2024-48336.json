  "Published": "2024-11-04T00:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-11-04T20:06:56.981Z",
  "Description": "The install() function of ProviderInstaller.java in Magisk App before canary version 27007 does not verify the GMS app before loading it, which allows a local untrusted app with no additional privileges to silently execute arbitrary code in the Magisk app and escalate privileges to root via a crafted package, aka Bug #8279. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",
