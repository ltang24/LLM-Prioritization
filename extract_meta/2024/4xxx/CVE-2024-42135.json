  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvhost_task: Handle SIGKILL by flushing work and exiting\n\nInstead of lingering until the device is closed, this has us handle\nSIGKILL by:\n\n1. marking the worker as killed so we no longer try to use it with\n   new virtqueues and new flush operations.\n2. setting the virtqueue to worker mapping so no new works are queued.\n3. running all the exiting works.",
