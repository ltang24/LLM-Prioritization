  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: mxs-dcp - Ensure payload is zero when using key slot\n\nWe could leak stack memory through the payload field when running\nAES with a key from one of the hardware's key slots. Fix this by\nensuring the payload field is set to 0 in such cases.\n\nThis does not affect the common use case when the key is supplied\nfrom main memory via the descriptor payload.",
