  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: ufs: core: Remove SCSI host only if added\n\nIf host tries to remove ufshcd driver from a UFS device it would cause a\nkernel panic if ufshcd_async_scan fails during ufshcd_probe_hba before\nadding a SCSI host with scsi_add_host and MCQ is enabled since SCSI host\nhas been defered after MCQ configuration introduced by commit 0cab4023ec7b\n(\"scsi: ufs: core: Defer adding host to SCSI if MCQ is supported\").\n\nTo guarantee that SCSI host is removed only if it has been added, set the\nscsi_host_added flag to true after adding a SCSI host and check whether it\nis set or not before removing it.",
