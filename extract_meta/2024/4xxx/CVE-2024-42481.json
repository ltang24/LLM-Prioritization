  "Description": "Skyport Daemon (skyportd) is the daemon for the Skyport Panel. By making thousands of folders & files (easy due to skyport's lack of rate limiting on createFolder. createFile), skyportd in a lot of cases will cause 100% CPU usage and an OOM, probably crashing the system. This is fixed in 0.2.2.",
