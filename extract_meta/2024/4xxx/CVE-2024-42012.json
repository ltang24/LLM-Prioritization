  "Description": "GRAU DATA Blocky before 3.1 stores passwords encrypted rather than hashed. At the login screen, the user's password is compared to the user's decrypted cleartext password. An attacker with Windows admin or debugging rights can therefore steal the user's Blocky password and from there impersonate that local user.",
