  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: don't unoptimize message in spi_async()\n\nCalling spi_maybe_unoptimize_message() in spi_async() is wrong because\nthe message is likely to be in the queue and not transferred yet. This\ncan corrupt the message while it is being used by the controller driver.\n\nspi_maybe_unoptimize_message() is already called in the correct place\nin spi_finalize_current_message() to balance the call to\nspi_maybe_optimize_message() in spi_async().",
