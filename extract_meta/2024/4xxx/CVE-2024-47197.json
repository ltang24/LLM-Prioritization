  "Description": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information vulnerability in Maven Archetype Plugin.\n\nThis issue affects Maven Archetype Plugin: from 3.2.1 before 3.3.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 3.3.0, which fixes the issue.\n\nArchetype integration testing creates a file\ncalled ./target/classes/archetype-it/archetype-settings.xml\nThis file contains all the content from the users ~/.m2/settings.xml file,\nwhich often contains information they do not want to publish. We expect that on many developer machines, this also contains\ncredentials.\n\nWhen the user runs mvn verify again (without a mvn clean), this file becomes part of\nthe final artifact.\n\nIf a developer were to publish this into Maven Central or any other remote repository (whether as a release\nor a snapshot) their credentials would be published without them knowing.",
