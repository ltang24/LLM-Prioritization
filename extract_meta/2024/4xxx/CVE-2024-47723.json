  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njfs: fix out-of-bounds in dbNextAG() and diAlloc()\n\nIn dbNextAG() , there is no check for the case where bmp->db_numag is\ngreater or same than MAXAG due to a polluted image, which causes an\nout-of-bounds. Therefore, a bounds check should be added in dbMount().\n\nAnd in dbNextAG(), a check for the case where agpref is greater than\nbmp->db_numag should be added, so an out-of-bounds exception should be\nprevented.\n\nAdditionally, a check for the case where agno is greater or same than\nMAXAG should be added in diAlloc() to prevent out-of-bounds.",
