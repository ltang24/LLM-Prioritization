  "Description": "The Jeg Elementor Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the sg_general_toggle_tab_enable and sg_accordion_style attributes within the plugin's JKit - Tabs and JKit - Accordion widget, respectively, in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
