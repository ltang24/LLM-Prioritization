  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npinmux: Use sequential access to access desc->pinmux data\n\nWhen two client of the same gpio call pinctrl_select_state() for the\nsame functionality, we are seeing NULL pointer issue while accessing\ndesc->mux_owner.\n\nLet's say two processes A, B executing in pin_request() for the same pin\nand process A updates the desc->mux_usecount but not yet updated the\ndesc->mux_owner while process B see the desc->mux_usecount which got\nupdated by A path and further executes strcmp and while accessing\ndesc->mux_owner it crashes with NULL pointer.\n\nSerialize the access to mux related setting with a mutex lock.\n\n\tcpu0 (process A)\t\t\tcpu1(process B)\n\npinctrl_select_state() {\t\t  pinctrl_select_state() {\n  pin_request() {\t\t\t\tpin_request() {\n  ...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ....\n    } else {\n         desc->mux_usecount++;\n    \t\t\t\t\t\tdesc->mux_usecount && strcmp(desc->mux_owner, owner)) {\n\n         if (desc->mux_usecount > 1)\n               return 0;\n         desc->mux_owner = owner;\n\n  }\t\t\t\t\t\t}",
