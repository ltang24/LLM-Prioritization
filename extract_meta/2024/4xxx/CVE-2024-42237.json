  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirmware: cs_dsp: Validate payload length before processing block\n\nMove the payload length check in cs_dsp_load() and cs_dsp_coeff_load()\nto be done before the block is processed.\n\nThe check that the length of a block payload does not exceed the number\nof remaining bytes in the firwmware file buffer was being done near the\nend of the loop iteration. However, some code before that check used the\nlength field without validating it.",
