  "Description": "Monkeytype is a minimalistic and customizable typing test. Monkeytype is vulnerable to Poisoned Pipeline Execution through Code Injection in its ci-failure-comment.yml GitHub Workflow, enabling attackers to gain pull-requests write access. The ci-failure-comment.yml workflow is triggered when the Monkey CI workflow completes. When it runs, it will download an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow and assign the contents of ./pr_num/pr_num.txt artifact to the steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content WorkFlow variable. It is not validated that the variable is actually a number and later it is interpolated into a JS script allowing an attacker to change the code to be executed. This issue leads to pull-requests write access. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.30.0.",
