  "Description": "Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.21 and earlier are affected by a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser. This issue occurs when data from a malicious source is processed by a web application and subsequently written to the web page without proper sanitization, allowing for the execution of unintended script code or the alteration of the intended user interface. User interaction is required as the victim must visit a malicious page or view a maliciously crafted link.",
