  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix may_goto with negative offset.\n\nZac's syzbot crafted a bpf prog that exposed two bugs in may_goto.\nThe 1st bug is the way may_goto is patched. When offset is negative\nit should be patched differently.\nThe 2nd bug is in the verifier:\nwhen current state may_goto_depth is equal to visited state may_goto_depth\nit means there is an actual infinite loop. It's not correct to prune\nexploration of the program at this point.\nNote, that this check doesn't limit the program to only one may_goto insn,\nsince 2nd and any further may_goto will increment may_goto_depth only\nin the queued state pushed for future exploration. The current state\nwill have may_goto_depth == 0 regardless of number of may_goto insns\nand the verifier has to explore the program until bpf_exit.",
