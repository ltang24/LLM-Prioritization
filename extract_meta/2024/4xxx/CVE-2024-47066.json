  "Description": "Lobe Chat is an open-source artificial intelligence chat framework. Prior to version 1.19.13, server-side request forgery protection implemented in `src/app/api/proxy/route.ts` does not consider redirect and could be bypassed when attacker provides an external malicious URL which redirects to internal resources like a private network or loopback address. Version 1.19.13 contains an improved fix for the issue.",
