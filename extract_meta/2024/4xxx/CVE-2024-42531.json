  "Description": "Ezviz Internet PT Camera CS-CV246 D15655150 allows an unauthenticated host to access its live video stream by crafting a set of RTSP packets with a specific set of URLs that can be used to redirect the camera feed. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that the Anonymous120386 sample code can establish RTSP protocol communictaion, but cannot obtain video or audio data; thus, there is no risk.",
