  "Description": "Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache Lucene Replicator.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Lucene's replicator module: from 4.4.0 before 9.12.0.\nThe deprecated org.apache.lucene.replicator.http package is affected.\nThe org.apache.lucene.replicator.nrt package is not affected.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 9.12.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n The deserialization can only be triggered if users actively deploy an network-accessible implementation and a corresponding client using a HTTP library that uses the API (e.g., a custom servlet and HTTPClient). Java serialization filters (such as\u00a0-Djdk.serialFilter='!*' on the commandline) can mitigate the issue on vulnerable versions without impacting functionality.",
