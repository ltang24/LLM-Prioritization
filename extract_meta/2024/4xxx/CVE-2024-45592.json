  "Description": "auditor-bundle, formerly known as DoctrineAuditBundle, integrates auditor library into any Symfony 3.4+ application. Prior to version 5.2.6, there is an unescaped entity property enabling Javascript injection. This is possible because `%source_label%` in twig macro is not escaped. Therefore script tags can be inserted and are executed. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 6.0.0 and 5.2.6.",
