  "Description": "SummaryThis advisory addresses a security vulnerability in Mautic related to the \"Forget your password\" functionality. This vulnerability could be exploited by unauthenticated users to enumerate valid usernames.\n\nUser Enumeration via Timing Attack: A user enumeration vulnerability exists in the \"Forget your password\" functionality. Differences in response times for existing and non-existing users, combined with a lack of request limiting, allow an attacker to determine the existence of usernames through a timing-based attack.\n\nMitigationPlease update to a version that addresses this timing vulnerability, where password reset responses are normalized to respond at the same time regardless of user existence.",
