  "Description": "The WP SVG Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018type\u2019 parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, who have permissions to upload sanitized files, to bypass SVG sanitization and inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
