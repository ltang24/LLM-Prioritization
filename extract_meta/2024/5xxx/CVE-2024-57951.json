  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhrtimers: Handle CPU state correctly on hotplug\n\nConsider a scenario where a CPU transitions from CPUHP_ONLINE to halfway\nthrough a CPU hotunplug down to CPUHP_HRTIMERS_PREPARE, and then back to\nCPUHP_ONLINE:\n\nSince hrtimers_prepare_cpu() does not run, cpu_base.hres_active remains set\nto 1 throughout. However, during a CPU unplug operation, the tick and the\nclockevents are shut down at CPUHP_AP_TICK_DYING. On return to the online\nstate, for instance CFS incorrectly assumes that the hrtick is already\nactive, and the chance of the clockevent device to transition to oneshot\nmode is also lost forever for the CPU, unless it goes back to a lower state\nthan CPUHP_HRTIMERS_PREPARE once.\n\nThis round-trip reveals another issue; cpu_base.online is not set to 1\nafter the transition, which appears as a WARN_ON_ONCE in enqueue_hrtimer().\n\nAside of that, the bulk of the per CPU state is not reset either, which\nmeans there are dangling pointers in the worst case.\n\nAddress this by adding a corresponding startup() callback, which resets the\nstale per CPU state and sets the online flag.\n\n[ tglx: Make the new callback unconditionally available, remove the online\n  \tmodification in the prepare() callback and clear the remaining\n  \tstate in the starting callback instead of the prepare callback ]",
