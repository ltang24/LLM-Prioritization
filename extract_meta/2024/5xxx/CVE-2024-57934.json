  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfgraph: Add READ_ONCE() when accessing fgraph_array[]\n\nIn __ftrace_return_to_handler(), a loop iterates over the fgraph_array[]\nelements, which are fgraph_ops. The loop checks if an element is a\nfgraph_stub to prevent using a fgraph_stub afterward.\n\nHowever, if the compiler reloads fgraph_array[] after this check, it might\nrace with an update to fgraph_array[] that introduces a fgraph_stub. This\ncould result in the stub being processed, but the stub contains a null\n\"func_hash\" field, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nTo ensure that the gops compared against the fgraph_stub matches the gops\nprocessed later, add a READ_ONCE(). A similar patch appears in commit\n63a8dfb (\"function_graph: Add READ_ONCE() when accessing fgraph_array[]\").",
