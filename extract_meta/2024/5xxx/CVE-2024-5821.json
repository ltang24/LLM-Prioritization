  "Published": "2024-07-03T17:45:24.566Z",
  "Updated": "2024-08-01T21:25:02.649Z",
  "Description": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive files on the server by confusing the agent with incorrect file names. When a user requests the content of a file with a misspelled name, the agent attempts to correct the command and inadvertently reveals the content of the intended file, such as /etc/passwd. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential server compromise.",
