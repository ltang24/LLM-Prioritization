  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: endpoint: Fix PCI domain ID release in pci_epc_destroy()\n\npci_epc_destroy() invokes pci_bus_release_domain_nr() to release the PCI\ndomain ID, but there are two issues:\n\n  - 'epc->dev' is passed to pci_bus_release_domain_nr() which was already\n    freed by device_unregister(), leading to a use-after-free issue.\n\n  - Domain ID corresponds to the EPC device parent, so passing 'epc->dev'\n    is also wrong.\n\nFix these issues by passing 'epc->dev.parent' to\npci_bus_release_domain_nr() and also do it before device_unregister().\n\n[mani: reworded subject and description]",
