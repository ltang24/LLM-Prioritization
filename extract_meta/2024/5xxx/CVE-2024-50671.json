  "Description": "Incorrect access control in Adapt Learning Adapt Authoring Tool <= 0.11.3 allows attackers with Authenticated User roles to obtain email addresses via the \"Get users\" feature. The vulnerability occurs due to a flaw in permission verification logic, where the wildcard character in permitted URLs grants unintended access to endpoints restricted to users with Super Admin roles. This makes it possible for attackers to disclose the email addresses of all users.",
