  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nceph: fix memory leak in ceph_direct_read_write()\n\nThe bvecs array which is allocated in iter_get_bvecs_alloc() is leaked\nand pages remain pinned if ceph_alloc_sparse_ext_map() fails.\n\nThere is no need to delay the allocation of sparse_ext map until after\nthe bvecs array is set up, so fix this by moving sparse_ext allocation\na bit earlier.  Also, make a similar adjustment in __ceph_sync_read()\nfor consistency (a leak of the same kind in __ceph_sync_read() has been\naddressed differently).",
