  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe: Don't free job in TDR\n\nFreeing job in TDR is not safe as TDR can pass the run_job thread\nresulting in UAF. It is only safe for free job to naturally be called by\nthe scheduler. Rather free job in TDR, add to pending list.\n\n(cherry picked from commit ea2f6a77d0c40d97f4a4dc93fee4afe15d94926d)",
