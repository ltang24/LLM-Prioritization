  "Description": "LGSL (Live Game Server List) provides online status lists for online video games. Versions up to and including 6.2.1 contain a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the `Referer` HTTP header. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which is reflected in the HTML response without proper sanitization. When crafted malicious input is provided in the `Referer` header, it is echoed back into an HTML attribute in the application\u2019s response.
