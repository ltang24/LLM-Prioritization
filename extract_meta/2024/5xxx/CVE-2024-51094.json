  "Description": "An issue in Snipe-IT v.7.0.13 build 15514 allows a low-privileged attacker to modify their profile name and inject a malicious payload into the \"Name\" field. When an administrator later accesses the People Management page, exports the data as a CSV file, and opens it, the injected payload will be executed, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate internal system data from the CSV file to a remote server.",
