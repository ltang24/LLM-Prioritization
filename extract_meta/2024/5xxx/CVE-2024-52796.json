  "Description": "Password Pusher, an open source application to communicate sensitive information over the web, comes with a configurable rate limiter.  In versions prior to v1.49.0, the rate limiter could be bypassed by forging proxy headers allowing bad actors to send unlimited traffic to the site potentially causing a denial of service. In v1.49.0, a fix was implemented to only authorize proxies on local IPs which resolves this issue. As a workaround, one may add rules to one's proxy and/or firewall to not accept external proxy headers such as `X-Forwarded-*` from clients.",
