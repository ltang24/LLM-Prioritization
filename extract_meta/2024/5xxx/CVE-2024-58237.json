  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: consider that tail calls invalidate packet pointers\n\nTail-called programs could execute any of the helpers that invalidate\npacket pointers. Hence, conservatively assume that each tail call\ninvalidates packet pointers.\n\nMaking the change in bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() automatically makes\nuse of check_cfg() logic that computes 'changes_pkt_data' effect for\nglobal sub-programs, such that the following program could be\nrejected:\n\n    int tail_call(struct __sk_buff *sk)\n    {\n    \tbpf_tail_call_static(sk, &jmp_table, 0);\n    \treturn 0;\n    }\n\n    SEC(\"tc\")\n    int not_safe(struct __sk_buff *sk)\n    {\n    \tint *p = (void *)(long)sk->data;\n    \t... make p valid ...\n    \ttail_call(sk);\n    \t*p = 42; /* this is unsafe */\n    \t...\n    }\n\nThe tc_bpf2bpf.c:subprog_tc() needs change: mark it as a function that\ncan invalidate packet pointers. Otherwise, it can't be freplaced with\ntailcall_freplace.c:entry_freplace() that does a tail call.",
