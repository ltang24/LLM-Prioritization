  "Description": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Umbraco CMS v14.3.1 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload. NOTE: This has been disputed by the vendor since this potential attack is only possible via authenticated users who have been manually allowed access to the CMS. There was a deliberate decision made not to apply HTML sanitization at the product level.",
