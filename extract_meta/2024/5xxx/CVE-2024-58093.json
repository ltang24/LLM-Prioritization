  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI/ASPM: Fix link state exit during switch upstream function removal\n\nBefore 456d8aa37d0f (\"PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM on MFD function removal to\navoid use-after-free\"), we would free the ASPM link only after the last\nfunction on the bus pertaining to the given link was removed.\n\nThat was too late. If function 0 is removed before sibling function,\nlink->downstream would point to free'd memory after.\n\nAfter above change, we freed the ASPM parent link state upon any function\nremoval on the bus pertaining to a given link.\n\nThat is too early. If the link is to a PCIe switch with MFD on the upstream\nport, then removing functions other than 0 first would free a link which\nstill remains parent_link to the remaining downstream ports.\n\nThe resulting GPFs are especially frequent during hot-unplug, because\npciehp removes devices on the link bus in reverse order.\n\nOn that switch, function 0 is the virtual P2P bridge to the internal bus.\nFree exactly when function 0 is removed -- before the parent link is\nobsolete, but after all subordinate links are gone.\n\n[kwilczynski: commit log]",
