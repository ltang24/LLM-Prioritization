  "Description": "Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is a pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. In versions prior to 3.9.7, the requests.get() request in the _check_url method is specified as allow_redirects=True, which allows a server-side request forgery when a request to .well-known/assetlinks.json\" returns a 302 redirect. This is a bypass of the fix for CVE-2024-29190 and is fixed in 3.9.7.",
