  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: dapm: fix bounds checker error in dapm_widget_list_create\n\nThe widgets array in the snd_soc_dapm_widget_list has a __counted_by\nattribute attached to it, which points to the num_widgets variable. This\nattribute is used in bounds checking, and if it is not set before the\narray is filled, then the bounds sanitizer will issue a warning or a\nkernel panic if CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP is set.\n\nThis patch sets the size of the widgets list calculated with\nlist_for_each as the initial value for num_widgets as it is used for\nallocating memory for the array. It is updated with the actual number of\nadded elements after the array is filled.",
