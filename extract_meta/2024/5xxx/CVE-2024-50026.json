  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: wd33c93: Don't use stale scsi_pointer value\n\nA regression was introduced with commit dbb2da557a6a (\"scsi: wd33c93:\nMove the SCSI pointer to private command data\") which results in an oops\nin wd33c93_intr(). That commit added the scsi_pointer variable and\ninitialized it from hostdata->connected. However, during selection,\nhostdata->connected is not yet valid. Fix this by getting the current\nscsi_pointer from hostdata->selecting.",
