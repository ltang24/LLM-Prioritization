  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: cope racing subflow creation in mptcp_rcv_space_adjust\n\nAdditional active subflows - i.e. created by the in kernel path\nmanager - are included into the subflow list before starting the\n3whs.\n\nA racing recvmsg() spooling data received on an already established\nsubflow would unconditionally call tcp_cleanup_rbuf() on all the\ncurrent subflows, potentially hitting a divide by zero error on\nthe newly created ones.\n\nExplicitly check that the subflow is in a suitable state before\ninvoking tcp_cleanup_rbuf().",
