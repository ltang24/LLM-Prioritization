  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"libfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir\"\n\nThe current directory offset allocator (based on mtree_alloc_cyclic)\nstores the next offset value to return in octx->next_offset. This\nmechanism typically returns values that increase monotonically over\ntime. Eventually, though, the newly allocated offset value wraps\nback to a low number (say, 2) which is smaller than other already-\nallocated offset values.\n\nYu Kuai <yukuai3@huawei.com> reports that, after commit 64a7ce76fb90\n(\"libfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir\"), if a\ndirectory's offset allocator wraps, existing entries are no longer\nvisible via readdir/getdents because offset_readdir() stops listing\nentries once an entry's offset is larger than octx->next_offset.\nThese entries vanish persistently -- they can be looked up, but will\nnever again appear in readdir(3) output.\n\nThe reason for this is that the commit treats directory offsets as\nmonotonically increasing integer values rather than opaque cookies,\nand introduces this comparison:\n\n\tif (dentry2offset(dentry) >= last_index) {\n\nOn 64-bit platforms, the directory offset value upper bound is\n2^63 - 1. Directory offsets will monotonically increase for millions\nof years without wrapping.\n\nOn 32-bit platforms, however, LONG_MAX is 2^31 - 1. The allocator\ncan wrap after only a few weeks (at worst).\n\nRevert commit 64a7ce76fb90 (\"libfs: fix infinite directory reads for\noffset dir\") to prepare for a fix that can work properly on 32-bit\nsystems and might apply to recent LTS kernels where shmem employs\nthe simple_offset mechanism.",
