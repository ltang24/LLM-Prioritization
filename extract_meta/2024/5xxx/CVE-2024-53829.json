  "Description": "CodeChecker is an analyzer tooling, defect database and viewer extension for the Clang Static Analyzer and Clang Tidy. \nCross-site request forgery allows an unauthenticated attacker to hijack the authentication of a logged in user, and use the web API with the same permissions,\u00a0including but not limited to adding, removing or editing products. The attacker needs to know the ID of the available products to modify or delete them. The attacker cannot directly exfiltrate data (view) from CodeChecker, due to being limited to form-based CSRF.\n\nThis issue affects CodeChecker: through 6.24.4.",
