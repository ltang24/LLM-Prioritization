The `register` function in `RegisterLoginReset.vue` contains a reflected XSS vulnerability due to an incorrect sanitization function. An attacker can specify a malicious `redirectTo` parameter to trigger the vulnerability, giving the attacker control of the victim\u2019s account when a victim registers or logins with a specially crafted link. Version 5.28.5 contains a patch.",
