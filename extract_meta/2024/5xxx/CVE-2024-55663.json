  "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 6.3-milestone-2 and prior to versions 13.10.5 and 14.3-rc-1, in `getdocument.vm`; the ordering of the returned documents is defined from an unsanitized request parameter (request.sort) and can allow any user to inject HQL. Depending on the used database backend, the attacker may be able to not only obtain confidential information such as password hashes from the database, but also execute UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries. This has been patched in 13.10.5 and 14.3-rc-1. There is no known workaround, other than upgrading XWiki.",
