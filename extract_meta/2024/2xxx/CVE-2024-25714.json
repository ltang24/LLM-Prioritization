  "CVE Code": "CVE-2024-25714",
  "Published": "2024-02-11T00:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-01T23:52:06.192Z",
  "Description": "In Rhonabwy through 1.1.13, HMAC signature verification uses a strcmp function that is vulnerable to side-channel attacks, because it stops the comparison when the first difference is spotted in the two signatures. (The fix uses gnutls_memcmp, which has constant-time execution.)",
