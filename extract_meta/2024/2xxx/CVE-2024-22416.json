  "Description": "pyLoad is a free and open-source Download Manager written in pure Python. The `pyload` API allows any API call to be made using GET requests. Since the session cookie is not set to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library up to severe attack possibilities via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. As a result any API call can be made via a CSRF attack by an unauthenticated user. This issue has been addressed in release `0.5.0b3.dev78`. All users are advised to upgrade.",
