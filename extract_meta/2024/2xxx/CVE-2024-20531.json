  "Description": "A vulnerability in the API of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of an affected device and conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack through an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need valid Super Admin credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing XML input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system or conduct an SSRF attack through the affected device.",
