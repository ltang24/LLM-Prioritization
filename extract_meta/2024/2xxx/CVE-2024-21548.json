An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through Bun's APIs that accept objects.\r\r**Note:** This issue relates to the widely known and actively developed 'Bun' JavaScript runtime. The bun package on NPM at versions 0.0.12 and below belongs to a different and older project that happened to claim the 'bun' name in the past.",
