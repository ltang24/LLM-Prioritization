  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not validate user input adequately. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as an Administrator and sending crafted SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain unauthorized data from the database and make changes to the system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need Administrator-level privileges.",
