  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IP Phone firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve sensitive information from an affected device.  \r\n\r This vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication for specific endpoints of the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device, enabling the recording of user credentials and traffic to and from the affected device, including VoIP calls that could be replayed.",
