  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: Fix WARNING in _copy_from_iter\n\nSyzkaller reports a warning in _copy_from_iter because an\niov_iter is supposedly used in the wrong direction. The reason\nis that syzcaller managed to generate a request with\na transfer direction of SG_DXFER_TO_FROM_DEV. This instructs\nthe kernel to copy user buffers into the kernel, read into\nthe copied buffers and then copy the data back to user space.\n\nThus the iovec is used in both directions.\n\nDetect this situation in the block layer and construct a new\niterator with the correct direction for the copy-in.",
