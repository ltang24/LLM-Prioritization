  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirewire: nosy: ensure user_length is taken into account when fetching packet contents\n\nEnsure that packet_buffer_get respects the user_length provided. If\nthe length of the head packet exceeds the user_length, packet_buffer_get\nwill now return 0 to signify to the user that no data were read\nand a larger buffer size is required. Helps prevent user space overflows.",
