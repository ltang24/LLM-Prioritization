For BIG-IP Advanced WAF and ASM, this may occur when either a DoS or Bot Defense profile is configured on a virtual server and the DB variables avr.IncludeServerInURI\u00a0or avr.CollectOnlyHostnameFromURI\u00a0are enabled.\n\nNote: The DB variables avr.IncludeServerInURI\u00a0and avr.CollectOnlyHostnameFromURI\u00a0are not enabled by default. For more information about the HTTP Analytics profile and the Collect URLs\u00a0setting, refer to  K30875743: Create a new Analytics profile and attach it to your virtual servers https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K30875743 .\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNote: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated",
