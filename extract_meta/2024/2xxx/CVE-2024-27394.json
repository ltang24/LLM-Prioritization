  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: Fix Use-After-Free in tcp_ao_connect_init\n\nSince call_rcu, which is called in the hlist_for_each_entry_rcu traversal\nof tcp_ao_connect_init, is not part of the RCU read critical section, it\nis possible that the RCU grace period will pass during the traversal and\nthe key will be free.\n\nTo prevent this, it should be changed to hlist_for_each_entry_safe.",
