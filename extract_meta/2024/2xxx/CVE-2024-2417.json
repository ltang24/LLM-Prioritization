  "Updated": "2024-08-12T20:25:56.027Z",
  "Description": "The User Registration \u2013 Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile WordPress Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the form_save_action() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update the registration form and make the default registration role administrator. This subsequently allows the attacker to register an account as an administrator on the site.",
