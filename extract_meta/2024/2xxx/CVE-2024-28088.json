  "CVE Code": "CVE-2024-28088",
  "Published": "2024-03-03T00:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-26T19:44:45.330Z",
  "Description": "LangChain through 0.1.10 allows ../ directory traversal by an actor who is able to control the final part of the path parameter in a load_chain call. This bypasses the intended behavior of loading configurations only from the hwchase17/langchain-hub GitHub repository. The outcome can be disclosure of an API key for a large language model online service, or remote code execution. (A patch is available as of release 0.1.29 of langchain-core.)",
