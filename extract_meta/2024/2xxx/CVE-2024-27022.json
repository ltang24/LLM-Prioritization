  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfork: defer linking file vma until vma is fully initialized\n\nThorvald reported a WARNING [1]. And the root cause is below race:\n\n CPU 1\t\t\t\t\tCPU 2\n fork\t\t\t\t\thugetlbfs_fallocate\n  dup_mmap\t\t\t\t hugetlbfs_punch_hole\n   i_mmap_lock_write(mapping);\n   vma_interval_tree_insert_after -- Child vma is visible through i_mmap tree.\n   i_mmap_unlock_write(mapping);\n   hugetlb_dup_vma_private -- Clear vma_lock outside i_mmap_rwsem!\n\t\t\t\t\t i_mmap_lock_write(mapping);\n   \t\t\t\t\t hugetlb_vmdelete_list\n\t\t\t\t\t  vma_interval_tree_foreach\n\t\t\t\t\t   hugetlb_vma_trylock_write -- Vma_lock is cleared.\n   tmp->vm_ops->open -- Alloc new vma_lock outside i_mmap_rwsem!\n\t\t\t\t\t   hugetlb_vma_unlock_write -- Vma_lock is assigned!!!\n\t\t\t\t\t i_mmap_unlock_write(mapping);\n\nhugetlb_dup_vma_private() and hugetlb_vm_op_open() are called outside\ni_mmap_rwsem lock while vma lock can be used in the same time.  Fix this\nby deferring linking file vma until vma is fully initialized.  Those vmas\nshould be initialized first before they can be used.",
