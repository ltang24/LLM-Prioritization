  "Description": "Supabase PostgreSQL v15.1 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the component /pg_meta/default/query. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this is an intended feature; also, it exists in the Supabase dashboard product, not the Supabase PostgreSQL product. Specifically, /pg_meta/default/query is for SQL queries that are entered in an intended UI by an authorized user. Nothing is injected.",
