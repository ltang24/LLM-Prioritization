  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/buddy: Fix alloc_range() error handling code\n\nFew users have observed display corruption when they boot\nthe machine to KDE Plasma or playing games. We have root\ncaused the problem that whenever alloc_range() couldn't\nfind the required memory blocks the function was returning\nSUCCESS in some of the corner cases.\n\nThe right approach would be if the total allocated size\nis less than the required size, the function should\nreturn -ENOSPC.",
