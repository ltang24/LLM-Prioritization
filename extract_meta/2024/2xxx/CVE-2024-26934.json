  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: core: Fix deadlock in usb_deauthorize_interface()\n\nAmong the attribute file callback routines in\ndrivers/usb/core/sysfs.c, the interface_authorized_store() function is\nthe only one which acquires a device lock on an ancestor device: It\ncalls usb_deauthorize_interface(), which locks the interface's parent\nUSB device.\n\nThe will lead to deadlock if another process already owns that lock\nand tries to remove the interface, whether through a configuration\nchange or because the device has been disconnected.  As part of the\nremoval procedure, device_del() waits for all ongoing sysfs attribute\ncallbacks to complete.  But usb_deauthorize_interface() can't complete\nuntil the device lock has been released, and the lock won't be\nreleased until the removal has finished.\n\nThe mechanism provided by sysfs to prevent this kind of deadlock is\nto use the sysfs_break_active_protection() function, which tells sysfs\nnot to wait for the attribute callback.\n\nReported-and-tested by: Yue Sun <samsun1006219@gmail.com>\nReported by: xingwei lee <xrivendell7@gmail.com>",
