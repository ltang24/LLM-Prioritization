  "Description": "A security vulnerability has been identified in the cryptlib cryptographic library when cryptlib is compiled with the support for RSA key exchange ciphersuites in TLS (by setting the USE_RSA_SUITES define), it will be vulnerable to the timing variant of the Bleichenbacher attack. An attacker that is able to perform a large number of connections to the server will be able to decrypt RSA ciphertexts or forge signatures using server's certificate.",
