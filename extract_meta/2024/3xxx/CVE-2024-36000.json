  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/hugetlb: fix missing hugetlb_lock for resv uncharge\n\nThere is a recent report on UFFDIO_COPY over hugetlb:\n\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/000000000000ee06de0616177560@google.com/\n\n350:\tlockdep_assert_held(&hugetlb_lock);\n\nShould be an issue in hugetlb but triggered in an userfault context, where\nit goes into the unlikely path where two threads modifying the resv map\ntogether.  Mike has a fix in that path for resv uncharge but it looks like\nthe locking criteria was overlooked: hugetlb_cgroup_uncharge_folio_rsvd()\nwill update the cgroup pointer, so it requires to be called with the lock\nheld.",
