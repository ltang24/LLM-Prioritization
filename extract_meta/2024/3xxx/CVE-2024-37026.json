  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe: Only use reserved BCS instances for usm migrate exec queue\n\nThe GuC context scheduling queue is 2 entires deep, thus it is possible\nfor a migration job to be stuck behind a fault if migration exec queue\nshares engines with user jobs. This can deadlock as the migrate exec\nqueue is required to service page faults. Avoid deadlock by only using\nreserved BCS instances for usm migrate exec queue.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 04f4a70a183a688a60fe3882d6e4236ea02cfc67)",
