  "Description": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the routing process daemon (rpd) of\u00a0Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker to send a malformed BGP Path attribute update which allocates memory used to log the bad path attribute. This memory is not properly freed in all circumstances, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nConsumed memory can be freed by manually restarting Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd).\n\nMemory utilization could be monitored by:\u00a0\nuser@host> show system memory or show system monitor memory status\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS:\u00a0  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8,\u00a0\n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S8,\n\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3,\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2, 23.4R2.\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8-EVO, \n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S8-EVO,\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4-EVO, \n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3-EVO, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3-EVO,\n\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1-EVO, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2-EVO, 23.4R2-EVO.",
