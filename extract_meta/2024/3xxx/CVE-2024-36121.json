  "Description": " netty-incubator-codec-ohttp is the OHTTP implementation for netty. BoringSSLAEADContext keeps track of how many OHTTP responses have been sent and uses this sequence number to calculate the appropriate nonce to use with the encryption algorithm. Unfortunately, two separate errors combine which would allow an attacker to cause the sequence number to overflow and thus the nonce to repeat.",

    "CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor",
    "CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound",
