  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nDrivers: hv: vmbus: Leak pages if set_memory_encrypted() fails\n\nIn CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to cause\nset_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an\nerror is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to\ntake care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)\nmemory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security\nissues.\n\nVMBus code could free decrypted pages if set_memory_encrypted()/decrypted()\nfails. Leak the pages if this happens.",
