  "Description": "The adapter @hono/node-server allows you to run your Hono application on Node.js. Prior to 1.10.1, the application hangs when receiving a Host header with a value that `@hono/node-server` can't handle well. Invalid values are those that cannot be parsed by the `URL` as a hostname such as an empty string, slashes `/`, and other strings. The version 1.10.1 includes the fix for this issue.",
