  "Description": "An Out-of-Bounds Read vulnerability in\n\nthe routing protocol daemon (rpd) of \n\n Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved\u00a0allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker sending a specifically malformed BGP packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\n\nThis issue only affects systems configured in\n      either of two ways:\n\n    \n    \n        *  systems with BGP traceoptions enabled\n\n        *  systems with BGP traffic engineering\n          configured\n\n    \n\n\nThis issue can affect iBGP and eBGP with \n\nany address family\n\n configured.\u00a0The specific attribute involved is non-transitive, and will not propagate across a network.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8,\n  *  22.2 before 22.2R3-S5,\u00a0\n  *  22.3 before 22.3R3-S4,\u00a0\n  *  22.4 before 22.4R3-S3,\u00a0\n  *  23.2 before 23.2R2-S2,\u00a0\n  *  23.4 before 23.4R2;\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S5-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S4-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S3-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S2-EVO,\u00a0\n  *  23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-EVO.",
