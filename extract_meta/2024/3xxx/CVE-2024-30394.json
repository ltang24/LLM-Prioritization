  "Description": "A\u00a0Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) component of Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause an rpd crash, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nOn all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, when EVPN is configured, and a specific EVPN type-5 route is received via BGP, rpd crashes and restarts. Continuous receipt of this specific route will lead to a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nThis issue affects:\nJunos OS:\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S7,\n\n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S5,\n\n  *  from 22.1 before 22.1R3-S4,\n\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S2,\n\n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S1,\n\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3,\n\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2.\n\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 21.4R3-S5-EVO,\n\n  *  from 22.1-EVO before 22.1R3-S4-EVO,\n\n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S2-EVO,\n\n  *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S1-EVO,\n\n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-EVO,\n\n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO.",
