  "Description": "The Cooked Pro recipe plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the `_recipe_settings[post_title]` parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.7.15.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This vulnerability allows authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses a compromised page. A patch is available at commit 8cf88f334ccbf11134080bbb655c66f1cfe77026 and will be part of version 1.8.0.",
