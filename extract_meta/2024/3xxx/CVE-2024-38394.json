  "Published": "2024-06-15T00:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-11-12T20:55:53.239Z",
  "Description": "Mismatches in interpreting USB authorization policy between GNOME Settings Daemon (GSD) through 46.0 and the Linux kernel's underlying device matching logic allow a physically proximate attacker to access some unintended Linux kernel USB functionality, such as USB device-specific kernel modules and filesystem implementations. NOTE: the GSD supplier indicates that consideration of a mitigation for this within GSD would be in the context of \"a new feature, not a CVE.\"",
