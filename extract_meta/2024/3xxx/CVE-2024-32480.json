  "Description": "LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. Versions prior to 24.4.0 are vulnerable to SQL injection. The `order` parameter is obtained from `$request`. After performing a string check, the value is directly incorporated into an SQL statement and concatenated, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker may extract a whole database this way. Version 24.4.0 fixes the issue.",
