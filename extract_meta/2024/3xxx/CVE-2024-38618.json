  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: timer: Set lower bound of start tick time\n\nCurrently ALSA timer doesn't have the lower limit of the start tick\ntime, and it allows a very small size, e.g. 1 tick with 1ns resolution\nfor hrtimer.  Such a situation may lead to an unexpected RCU stall,\nwhere  the callback repeatedly queuing the expire update, as reported\nby fuzzer.\n\nThis patch introduces a sanity check of the timer start tick time, so\nthat the system returns an error when a too small start size is set.\nAs of this patch, the lower limit is hard-coded to 100us, which is\nsmall enough but can still work somehow.",
