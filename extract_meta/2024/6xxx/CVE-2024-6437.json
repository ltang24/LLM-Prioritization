  "Description": "On affected platforms running Arista EOS with one of the following features configured to redirect IP traffic to a next hop: policy-based routing (PBR), BGP Flowspec, or interface traffic policy -- certain IP traffic such as IPv4 packets with IP options may bypass the feature's set nexthop\u00a0action and be slow-path forwarded (FIB routed) by the kernel as the packets are trapped to the CPU instead of following the redirect action's destination.",
