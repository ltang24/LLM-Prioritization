  "Description": "Directus v10.13.0 allows an authenticated external attacker to modify presets created by the same user to assign them to another user. This is possible because the application only validates the user parameter in the 'POST /presets'\u00a0request but not in the PATCH request. When chained with CVE-2024-6533, it could result in account takeover.",
