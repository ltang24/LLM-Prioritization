  "Description": "An exposure of sensitive information vulnerability exists in the Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk\u00ae System Service. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by starting a back-up or restore process, which\u00a0temporarily exposes private keys, passwords, pre-shared keys, and database folders when they are temporarily copied to an interim folder.
