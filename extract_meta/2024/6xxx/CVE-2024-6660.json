  "Updated": "2024-08-01T21:41:04.263Z",
  "Description": "The BookingPress \u2013 Appointment Booking Calendar Plugin and Online Scheduling Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the bookingpress_import_data_continue_process_func function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site and upload arbitrary files. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.",
