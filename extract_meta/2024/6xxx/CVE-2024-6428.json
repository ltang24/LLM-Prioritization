  "Description": "Mattermost versions 9.8.0, 9.7.x <= 9.7.4, 9.6.x <= 9.6.2, 9.5.x <= 9.5.5 fail to prevent specifying a RemoteId when creating a new user which allows an attacker to specify both a remoteId and the user ID, resulting in creating a user with a user-defined user ID. This can cause some broken functionality in User Management such administrative actions against the user not working.",
