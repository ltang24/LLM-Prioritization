  "Description": "In the `manim` plugin of binary-husky/gpt_academic, versions prior to the fix, a vulnerability exists due to improper handling of user-provided prompts. The root cause is the execution of untrusted code generated by the LLM without a proper sandbox. This allows an attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on the app backend server by injecting malicious code through the prompt.",
