  "Updated": "2024-09-16T14:33:10.067Z",
  "Description": "The MiCard PLUS Ci and MiCard PLUS BLE reader products developed by rf IDEAS and rebranded by NT-ware have a firmware fault that may result in characters randomly being dropped from some ID card reads, which would result in the wrong ID card number being assigned during ID card self-registration and might result in failed login attempts for end-users. Random characters being dropped from ID card numbers compromises the uniqueness of ID cards that can, therefore, result in a security issue if the users are using the \u2018ID card self-registration\u2019 function.",
