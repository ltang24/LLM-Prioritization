  "Updated": "2025-04-11T22:03:16.211Z",
  "Description": "The urllib.parse.urlsplit() and urlparse() functions improperly validated bracketed hosts (`[]`), allowing hosts that weren't IPv6 or IPvFuture. This behavior was not conformant to RFC 3986 and potentially enabled SSRF if a URL is processed by more than one URL parser.",
