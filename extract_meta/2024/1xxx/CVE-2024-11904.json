  "Description": "The \ucf54\ub4dc\uc5e0\uc0f5 \uc18c\uc15c\ud1a1 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'msntt_add_plus_talk' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
