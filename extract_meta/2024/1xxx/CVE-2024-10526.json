  "Description": "Rapid7 Velociraptor MSI Installer versions below 0.73.3 suffer from a vulnerability whereby it creates the installation directory with WRITE_DACL permission to the BUILTIN\\\\Users group. This allows local users who are not administrators to grant themselves the Full Control permission on Velociraptor's files. By modifying Velociraptor's files, local users can subvert the binary and cause the Velociraptor service to execute arbitrary code as the SYSTEM user, or to replace the Velociraptor binary completely.\u00a0 This issue is fixed in version 0.73.3.",
