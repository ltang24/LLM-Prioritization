  "Updated": "2025-01-09T15:17:35.410Z",
  "Description": "The Unlimited Elements For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple widgets in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.135 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Note: Since the widget code isn't part of the code, to apply the patch, the affected widgets: Image Tooltip, Notification, Simple Popup, Video Play Button, and Card Carousel, must be deleted and reinstalled manually.",
