  "Published": "2025-01-07T03:21:53.748Z",
  "Updated": "2025-01-07T16:29:41.573Z",
  "Description": "The Themes Coder \u2013 Create Android & iOS Apps For Your Woocommerce Site plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.4. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password through the update_user_profile() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.",
