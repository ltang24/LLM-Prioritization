  "Description": "The bodi0`s Easy cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'cache-folder' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 0.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
