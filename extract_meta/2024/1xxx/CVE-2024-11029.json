  "Published": "2025-01-15T12:55:30.964Z",
  "Updated": "2025-07-05T04:44:45.532Z",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in the FreeIPA API audit, where it sends the whole FreeIPA command line to journalctl. As a consequence, during the FreeIPA installation process, it inadvertently leaks the administrative user credentials, including the administrator password, to the journal database. In the worst-case scenario, where the journal log is centralized, users with access to it can have improper access to the FreeIPA administrator credentials.",
