A normal (non-admin) user could exploit the weakness in file and folder permissions to escalate privileges, execute arbitrary code and maintain persistence on the compromised machine. It has been identified that full control permissions exist on the \u2018Everyone\u2019 group (i.e. any user who has local access to the operating system regardless of their privileges).",
