  "Description": "The Favicon Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the output_sub_admin_page_0 function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The plugin author deleted the functionality of the plugin to patch this issue and close the plugin, we recommend seeking an alternative to this plugin.",
