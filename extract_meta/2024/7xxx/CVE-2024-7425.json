  "Description": "The WP ALL Export Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to improper user input validation and sanitization in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.",
