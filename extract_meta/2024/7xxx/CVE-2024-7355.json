  "Updated": "2024-08-07T13:12:15.350Z",
  "Description": "The Organization chart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018title_input\u2019 and 'node_description' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. By default, this can only be exploited by administrators, but the ability to use and configure charts can be extended to subscribers.",
