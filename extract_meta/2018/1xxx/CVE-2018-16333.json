  "Description": "An issue was discovered on Tenda AC7 V15.03.06.44_CN, AC9 V15.03.05.19(6318)_CN, AC10 V15.03.06.23_CN, AC15 V15.03.05.19_CN, and AC18 V15.03.05.19(6318)_CN devices. There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the router's web server. While processing the ssid parameter for a POST request, the value is directly used in a sprintf call to a local variable placed on the stack, which overrides the return address of the function, causing a buffer overflow.",
