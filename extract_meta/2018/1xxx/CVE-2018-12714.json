  "CVE Code": "CVE-2018-12714",
  "Published": "2018-06-24T23:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T08:45:01.179Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. The filter parsing in kernel/trace/trace_events_filter.c could be called with no filter, which is an N=0 case when it expected at least one line to have been read, thus making the N-1 index invalid. This allows attackers to cause a denial of service (slab out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted perf_event_open and mmap system calls.",
