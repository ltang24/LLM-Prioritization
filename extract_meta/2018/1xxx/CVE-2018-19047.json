  "Description": "mPDF through 7.1.6, if deployed as a web application that accepts arbitrary HTML, allows SSRF, as demonstrated by a '<img src=\"http://192.168' substring that triggers a call to getImage in Image/ImageProcessor.php. NOTE: the software maintainer disputes this, stating \"If you allow users to pass HTML without sanitising it, you're asking for trouble.",
