  "Description": "Tcpreplay v4.3.0 beta1 contains a heap-based buffer over-read. The get_next_packet() function in the send_packets.c file uses the memcpy() function unsafely to copy sequences from the source buffer pktdata to the destination (*prev_packet)->pktdata. This will result in a Denial of Service (DoS) and potentially Information Exposure when the application attempts to process a file.",
