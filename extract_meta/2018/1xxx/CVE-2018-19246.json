  "Description": "PHP-Proxy 5.1.0 allows remote attackers to read local files if the default \"pre-installed version\" (intended for users who lack shell access to their web server) is used. This occurs because the aeb067ca0aa9a3193dce3a7264c90187 app_key value from the default config.php is in place, and this value can be easily used to calculate the authorization data needed for local file inclusion.",
