  "Description": "The web management interface in the TP-Link EAP Controller and Omada Controller versions 2.5.4_Windows/2.6.0_Windows does not have Anti-CSRF tokens in any forms. This would allow an attacker to submit authenticated requests when an authenticated user browses an attack-controlled domain. This is fixed in version 2.6.1_Windows.",
