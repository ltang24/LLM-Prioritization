  "Published": "2019-03-17T21:49:26",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T11:37:11.537Z",
  "Description": "wg7.php in Webgalamb 7.0 makes opportunistic calls to htmlspecialchars() instead of using a templating engine with proper contextual encoding. Because it is possible to insert arbitrary strings into the database, any JavaScript could be executed by the administrator, leading to XSS.",
