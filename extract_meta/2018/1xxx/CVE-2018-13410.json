  "Updated": "2024-08-05T09:00:35.146Z",
  "Description": "Info-ZIP Zip 3.0, when the -T and -TT command-line options are used, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact because of an off-by-one error. NOTE: it is unclear whether there are realistic scenarios in which an untrusted party controls the -TT value, given that the entire purpose of -TT is execution of arbitrary commands",
