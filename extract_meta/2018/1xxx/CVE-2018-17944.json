  "Description": "On certain Lexmark devices that communicate with an LDAP or SMTP server, a malicious administrator can discover LDAP or SMTP credentials by changing that server's hostname to one that they control, and then capturing the credentials that are sent there. This occurs because stored credentials are not automatically deleted upon that type of hostname change.",
