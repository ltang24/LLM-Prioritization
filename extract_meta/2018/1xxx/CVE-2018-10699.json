  "Description": "An issue was discovered on Moxa AWK-3121 1.14 devices. The Moxa AWK 3121 provides certfile upload functionality so that an administrator can upload a certificate file used for connecting to the wireless network. However, the same functionality allows an attacker to execute commands on the device. The POST parameter \"iw_privatePass\" is susceptible to this injection. By crafting a packet that contains shell metacharacters, it is possible for an attacker to execute the attack.",
