  "Published": "2019-06-19T15:57:30",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T11:08:21.821Z",
  "Description": "The doAirdrop function of a smart contract implementation for Primeo (PEO), an Ethereum token, does not check the numerical relationship between the amount of the air drop and the token's total supply, which lets the owner of the contract issue an arbitrary amount of currency. (Increasing the total supply by using 'doAirdrop' ignores the hard cap written in the contract and devalues the token.)",
