  "Description": "The ProcessGpsInfo function of the gpsinfo.c file of jhead 3.00 may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack or unspecified other impact via a malicious JPEG file, because there is an integer overflow during a check for whether a location exceeds the EXIF data length. This is analogous to the CVE-2016-3822 integer overflow in exif.c. This gpsinfo.c vulnerability is unrelated to the CVE-2018-16554 gpsinfo.c vulnerability.",
