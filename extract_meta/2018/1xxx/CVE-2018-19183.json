  "Updated": "2024-08-05T11:30:04.282Z",
  "Description": "ethereumjs-vm 2.4.0 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (vm.runCode failure and REVERT) via a \"code: Buffer.from(my_code, 'hex')\" attribute. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because REVERT is a normal bytecode that can be triggered from high-level source code, leading to a normal programmatic execution result.",
