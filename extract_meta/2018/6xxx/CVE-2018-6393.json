  "Description": "FreePBX 10.13.66-32bit and 14.0.1.24 (SNG7-PBX-64bit-1712-2) allow post-authentication SQL injection via the order parameter. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because it is intentional that a user can \"directly modify SQL tables ... [or] run shell scripts ... once ... logged in to the administration interface; there is no need to try to find input validation errors.",
