  "Description": "BigTree 4.3 allows full path disclosure via authenticated admin/news/ input that triggers a syntax error. NOTE: This has been disputed with the following reasoning: \"The issue reported requires full developer level access to the content management system where cross site scripting is not an issue -- you already have full control of the CMS including running arbitrary PHP.",
