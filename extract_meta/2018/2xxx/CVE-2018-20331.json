  "Description": "Local attackers can trigger a Kernel Pool Buffer Overflow in Antiy AVL ATool v1.0.0.22. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of IOCTL 0x80002004 by the ssdt.sys kernel driver. The bug is caused by failure to properly validate the length of the user-supplied data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel, which could lead to privilege escalation. A failed exploit could lead to denial of service.",
