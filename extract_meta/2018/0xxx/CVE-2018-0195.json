The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks for requests that are sent to the REST API of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to an affected device via the REST API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to selectively bypass authorization checks for the REST API of the affected software and use the API to perform privileged actions on an affected device.
