Due to this issue, traffic that should have been blocked by other rules is permitted to flow through the device resulting in a firewall bypass condition. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D71 on SRX series; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D55 on SRX series; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D100 on SRX series.",
