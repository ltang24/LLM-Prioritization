  "Updated": "2024-09-16T17:22:52.478Z",
  "Description": "Read-Only export policy rules are not correctly enforced in Clustered Data ONTAP 8.3 Release Candidate versions and therefore may allow more than \"read-only\" access from authenticated SMBv2 and SMBv3 clients. This behavior has been resolved in the GA release. Customers running prior release candidates (RCs) are requested to update their systems to the NetApp Data ONTAP 8.3 GA release.",
