  "CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5743",
  "Published": "2019-10-09T14:17:14.293079Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-17T02:26:38.493Z",
  "Description": "By design, BIND is intended to limit the number of TCP clients that can be connected at any given time. The number of allowed connections is a tunable parameter which, if unset, defaults to a conservative value for most servers. Unfortunately, the code which was intended to limit the number of simultaneous connections contained an error which could be exploited to grow the number of simultaneous connections beyond this limit. Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -> 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -> 9.11.6, 9.12.0 -> 9.12.4, 9.14.0. BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.5-S3, and 9.11.5-S5. Versions 9.13.0 -> 9.13.7 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected. Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability to CVE-2018-5743.",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "By exploiting the failure to limit simultaneous TCP connections, an attacker can deliberately exhaust the pool of file descriptors available to named, potentially affecting network connections and the management of files such as log files or zone journal files.  In cases where the named process is not limited by OS-enforced per-process limits, this could additionally potentially lead to exhaustion of all available free file descriptors on that system."
