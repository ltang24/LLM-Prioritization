  "CVE Code": "CVE-2018-5131",
  "Published": "2018-06-11T21:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T05:26:46.949Z",
  "Description": "Under certain circumstances the \"fetch()\" API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a \"no-store\" or \"no-cache\" cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.7 and Firefox < 59.",

    "Fetch API improperly returns cached copies of no-store/no-cache resources"
