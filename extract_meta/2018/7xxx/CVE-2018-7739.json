  "Updated": "2024-08-05T06:37:58.066Z",
  "Description": "antsle antman before 0.9.1a allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via invalid characters in the username and password parameters, as demonstrated by a username=>&password=%0a string to the /login URI. This allows obtaining root permissions within the web management console, because the login process uses Java's ProcessBuilder class and a bash script called antsle-auth with insufficient input validation.",
