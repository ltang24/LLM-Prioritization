  "Updated": "2024-08-05T06:31:03.602Z",
  "Description": "Blue River Mura CMS before v7.0.7029 supports inline function calls with an [m] tag and [/m] end tag, without proper restrictions on file types or pathnames, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an [m]$.dspinclude(\"../pathname/executable.jpeg\")[/m] approach, where executable.jpeg contains ColdFusion Markup Language code. This can be exploited in conjunction with a CKFinder feature that allows file upload.",
