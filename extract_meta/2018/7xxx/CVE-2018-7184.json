  "Updated": "2024-08-05T06:24:11.248Z",
  "Description": "ntpd in ntp 4.2.8p4 before 4.2.8p11 drops bad packets before updating the \"received\" timestamp, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disruption) by sending a packet with a zero-origin timestamp causing the association to reset and setting the contents of the packet as the most recent timestamp. This issue is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-7704.",
