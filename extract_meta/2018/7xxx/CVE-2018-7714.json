  "Updated": "2024-08-05T06:31:05.066Z",
  "Description": "The validateInputImageSize function in modules/imgcodecs/src/loadsave.cpp in OpenCV 3.4.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure) because (pixels <= (1<<30)) may be false. Note: \u201cOpenCV CV_Assert is not an assertion (C-like assert()), it is regular C++ exception which can raised in case of invalid or non-supported parameters.",
