  "Description": "The DirectShow loader (loader/dshow/DS_VideoDecoder.c) in MPlayer 1.0rc1 and earlier, as used in xine-lib, does not set the biSize before use in a memcpy, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a buffer overflow and possibly execute arbitrary code, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-1246.",
