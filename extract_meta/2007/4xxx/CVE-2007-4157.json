  "Published": "2007-08-03T21:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-07T14:46:39.364Z",
  "Description": "PHPBlogger stores sensitive information under the web root with insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers to download a database containing an admin password hash via a direct request for data/pref.db.  NOTE: this can be easily leveraged for administrative access because composing the authentication cookie only requires the password hash, not the cleartext version.",
