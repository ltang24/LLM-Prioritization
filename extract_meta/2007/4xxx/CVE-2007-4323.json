  "Description": "DenyHosts 2.6 does not properly parse sshd log files, which allows remote attackers to add arbitrary hosts to the /etc/hosts.deny file and cause a denial of service by adding arbitrary IP addresses to the sshd log file, as demonstrated by logging in via ssh with a client protocol version identification containing an IP address string, a different vector than CVE-2006-6301.",
