  "Description": "contrib/mx_glance_sdesc.php in the mx_glance 2.3.3 module for mxBB places a critical security check within a comment because of a missing comment delimiter, which allows remote attackers to conduct remote file inclusion attacks and execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the mx_root_path parameter.  NOTE: some sources incorrectly state that phpbb_root_path is the affected parameter.",
