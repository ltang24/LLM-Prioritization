  "Description": "The process scheduler in the Microsoft Windows XP kernel does not make use of the process statistics kept by the kernel, performs scheduling based on CPU billing gathered from periodic process sampling ticks, and gives preference to \"interactive\" processes that perform voluntary sleeps, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption), as described in \"Secretly Monopolizing the CPU Without Superuser Privileges.\"",
