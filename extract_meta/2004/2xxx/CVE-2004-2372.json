  "Description": "Buffer overflow in Bochs before 2.1.1, if installed setuid, allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a long HOME environment variable, which is used if the .bochsrc, bochsrc, and bochsrc.txt cannot be found in a known path.  NOTE: some external documents recommend that Bochs be installed setuid root, so this should be treated as a vulnerability.",
