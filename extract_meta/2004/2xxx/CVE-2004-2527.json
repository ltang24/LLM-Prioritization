  "Updated": "2024-08-08T01:29:13.917Z",
  "Description": "The local and remote desktop login screens in Microsoft Windows XP before SP2 and 2003 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) by repeatedly using the WinKey+\"U\" key combination, which causes multiple copies of Windows Utility Manager to be loaded more quickly than they can be closed when the copies detect that another instance is running.",
