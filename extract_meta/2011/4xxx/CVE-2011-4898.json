  "CVE Code": "CVE-2011-4898",
  "Published": "2012-01-30T17:00:00Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-16T16:24:04.778Z",
  "Description": "wp-admin/setup-config.php in the installation component in WordPress 3.3.1 and earlier generates different error messages for requests lacking a dbname parameter depending on whether the MySQL credentials are valid, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force attacks via a series of requests with different uname and pwd parameters.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue; also, it is unclear whether providing intentionally vague error messages during installation would be reasonable from a usability perspective",
