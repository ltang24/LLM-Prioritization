  "Published": "2012-09-05T20:00:00Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-16T20:21:27.928Z",
  "Description": "actions/files/files.php in WikkaWiki 1.3.1 and 1.3.2, when INTRANET_MODE is enabled, supports file uploads for file extensions that are typically absent from an Apache HTTP Server TypesConfig file, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by placing this code in a file whose name has multiple extensions, as demonstrated by a (1) .mm or (2) .vpp file.",
