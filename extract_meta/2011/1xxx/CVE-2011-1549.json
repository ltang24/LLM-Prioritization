  "Updated": "2024-08-06T22:28:41.808Z",
  "Description": "The default configuration of logrotate on Gentoo Linux uses root privileges to process files in directories that permit non-root write access, which allows local users to conduct symlink and hard link attacks by leveraging logrotate's lack of support for untrusted directories, as demonstrated by directories under /var/log/ for packages.",
