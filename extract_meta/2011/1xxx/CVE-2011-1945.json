  "Published": "2011-05-31T20:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-06T22:46:00.682Z",
  "Description": "The elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) subsystem in OpenSSL 1.0.0d and earlier, when the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is used for the ECDHE_ECDSA cipher suite, does not properly implement curves over binary fields, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to determine private keys via a timing attack and a lattice calculation.",
