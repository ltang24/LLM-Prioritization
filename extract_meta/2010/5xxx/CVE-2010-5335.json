  "Description": "IceWarp Webclient before 10.2.1 has a directory traversal vulnerability. This can result in loss of confidential data of IceWarp Mailserver and the operating system. Input passed via a certain parameter (script to basic/minimizer/index.php) is not properly sanitised and can therefore be exploited to browse the partition where IceWarp is installed (or the whole system) and read arbitrary files.",
