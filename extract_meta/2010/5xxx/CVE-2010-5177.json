  "Published": "2012-08-25T21:00:00Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-17T03:07:37.755Z",
  "Description": "Race condition in Sophos Endpoint Security and Control 9.0.5 on Windows XP allows local users to bypass kernel-mode hook handlers, and execute dangerous code that would otherwise be blocked by a handler but not blocked by signature-based malware detection, via certain user-space memory changes during hook-handler execution, aka an argument-switch attack or a KHOBE attack.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because it is a flaw in a protection mechanism for situations where a crafted program has already begun to execute",
