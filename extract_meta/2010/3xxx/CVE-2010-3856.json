  "Updated": "2025-02-13T16:27:09.107Z",
  "Description": "ld.so in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.11.3, and 2.12.x before 2.12.2, does not properly restrict use of the LD_AUDIT environment variable to reference dynamic shared objects (DSOs) as audit objects, which allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging an unsafe DSO located in a trusted library directory, as demonstrated by libpcprofile.so.",
