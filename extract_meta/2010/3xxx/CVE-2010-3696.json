  "Updated": "2024-08-07T03:18:52.999Z",
  "Description": "The fr_dhcp_decode function in lib/dhcp.c in FreeRADIUS 2.1.9, in certain non-default builds, does not properly handle the DHCP Relay Agent Information option, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and daemon outage) via a packet that has more than one sub-option.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.",
