  "Description": "Opera before 10.53 on Windows and Mac OS X does not properly handle a series of document modifications that occur asynchronously, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via JavaScript that writes <marquee> sequences in an infinite loop, leading to attempted use of uninitialized memory.
