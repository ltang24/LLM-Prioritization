  "Updated": "2024-08-03T00:03:05.119Z",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in Undertow. For an AJP 400 response, EAP 7 is improperly sending two response packets, and those packets have the reuse flag set even though JBoss EAP closes the connection. A failure occurs when the connection is reused after a 400 by CPING since it reads in the second SEND_HEADERS response packet instead of a CPONG.",
