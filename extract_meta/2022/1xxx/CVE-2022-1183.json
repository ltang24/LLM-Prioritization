  "CVE Code": "CVE-2022-1183",
  "Published": "2022-05-19T09:55:09.565075Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-17T04:00:26.575Z",
  "Description": "On vulnerable configurations, the named daemon may, in some circumstances, terminate with an assertion failure. Vulnerable configurations are those that include a reference to http within the listen-on statements in their named.conf. TLS is used by both DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH), but configurations using DoT alone are unaffected. Affects BIND 9.18.0 -> 9.18.2 and version 9.19.0 of the BIND 9.19 development branch.",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "In BIND 9.18.0 -> 9.18.2 and version 9.19.0 of the BIND 9.19 development branch, an assertion failure can be triggered if a TLS connection to a configured http TLS listener with a defined endpoint is destroyed too early."
