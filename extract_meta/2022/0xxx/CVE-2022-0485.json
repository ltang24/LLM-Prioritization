  "Published": "2022-08-29T14:03:04",
  "Updated": "2024-08-02T23:32:45.848Z",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in the copying tool `nbdcopy` of libnbd. When performing multi-threaded copies using asynchronous nbd calls, nbdcopy was blindly treating the completion of an asynchronous command as successful, rather than checking the *error parameter. This could result in the silent creation of a corrupted destination image.",
