  "Published": "2022-12-12T01:49:10.008967Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-16T23:11:20.568Z",
  "Description": "All versions of package gitpython are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to improper user input validation, which makes it possible to inject a maliciously crafted remote URL into the clone command. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible because the library makes external calls to git without sufficient sanitization of input arguments.",
