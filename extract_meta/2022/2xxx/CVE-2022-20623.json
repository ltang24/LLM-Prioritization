  "Description": "A vulnerability in the rate limiter for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) traffic of Cisco NX-OS Software for Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause BFD traffic to be dropped on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a logic error in the BFD rate limiter functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of traffic through the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause BFD traffic to be dropped, resulting in BFD session flaps. BFD session flaps can cause route instability and dropped traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.",
