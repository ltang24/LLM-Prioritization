  "Description": "Clusters using Calico (version 3.22.1 and below), Calico Enterprise (version 3.12.0 and below), may be vulnerable to route hijacking with the floating IP feature. Due to insufficient validation, a privileged attacker may be able to set a floating IP annotation to a pod even if the feature is not enabled. This may allow the attacker to intercept and reroute traffic to their compromised pod.",
