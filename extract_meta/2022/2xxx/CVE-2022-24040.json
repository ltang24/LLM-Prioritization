  "CVE Code": "CVE-2022-24040",
  "Published": "2022-05-10T09:46:48",
  "Updated": "2024-08-03T03:59:23.638Z",
  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Desigo DXR2 (All versions < V01.21.142.5-22), Desigo PXC3 (All versions < V01.21.142.4-18), Desigo PXC4 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884), Desigo PXC5 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884). The web application fails to enforce an upper bound to the cost factor of the PBKDF2 derived key during the creation or update of an account. An attacker with the user profile access privilege could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition through CPU consumption by setting a PBKDF2 derived key with a remarkably high cost effort and then attempting a login to the so-modified account.",
