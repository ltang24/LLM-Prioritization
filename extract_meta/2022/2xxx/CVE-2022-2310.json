  "Description": "An authentication bypass vulnerability in Skyhigh SWG in main releases 10.x prior to 10.2.12, 9.x prior to 9.2.23, 8.x prior to 8.2.28, and controlled release 11.x prior to 11.2.1 allows a remote attacker to bypass authentication into the administration User Interface. This is possible because of SWG incorrectly whitelisting authentication bypass methods and using a weak crypto password. This can lead to the attacker logging into the SWG admin interface, without valid credentials, as the super user with complete control over the SWG.",
