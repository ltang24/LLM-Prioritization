  "Description": "The Banner Cycler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.4. This is due to missing nonce protection on the pabc_admin_slides_postback() function found in the ~/admin/admin.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts into the page, granted they can trick a site\u2019s administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link",
