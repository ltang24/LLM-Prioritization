  "Description": "Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.45 and 4.1.1, template authors could inject php code by choosing a malicious {block} name or {include} file name. Sites that cannot fully trust template authors should upgrade to versions 3.1.45 or 4.1.1 to receive a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.",
