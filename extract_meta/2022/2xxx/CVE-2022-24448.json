  "Updated": "2024-08-03T04:13:56.018Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file descriptor.",
