  "Description": "Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Proxy component of Apache Pulsar allows an attacker to make TCP/IP connection attempts that originate from the Pulsar Proxy's IP address. When the Apache Pulsar Proxy component is used, it is possible to attempt to open TCP/IP connections to any IP address and port that the Pulsar Proxy can connect to. An attacker could use this as a way for DoS attacks that originate from the Pulsar Proxy's IP address. It hasn\u2019t been detected that the Pulsar Proxy authentication can be bypassed. The attacker will have to have a valid token to a properly secured Pulsar Proxy. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Proxy versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.2; 2.9.0 to 2.9.1; 2.6.4 and earlier.",
