  "Description": "A vulnerability in the generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel decapsulation feature of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to a memory handling error that occurs when GRE traffic is processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted GRE payload through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to restart, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r    \r\n\r  https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-gre-dos-hmedHQPM [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-gre-dos-hmedHQPM\"]\r\n\r \r This advisory is part of the November 2022 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication.",
