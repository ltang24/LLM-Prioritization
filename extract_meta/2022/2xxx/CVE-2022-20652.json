  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface and in the API subsystem of Cisco&nbsp;Tetration could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands to be executed with root-level privileges on the underlying operating system.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP message to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root-level privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid administrator-level credentials.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
