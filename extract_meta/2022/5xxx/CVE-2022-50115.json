  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: SOF: ipc3-topology: Prevent double freeing of ipc_control_data via load_bytes\n\nWe have sanity checks for byte controls and if any of the fail the locally\nallocated scontrol->ipc_control_data is freed up, but not set to NULL.\n\nOn a rollback path of the error the higher level code will also try to free\nthe scontrol->ipc_control_data which will eventually going to lead to\nmemory corruption as double freeing memory is not a good thing.",
