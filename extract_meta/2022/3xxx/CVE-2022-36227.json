  "CVE Code": "CVE-2022-36227",
  "Published": "2022-11-22T00:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-03T10:00:04.305Z",
  "Description": "In libarchive before 3.6.2, the software does not check for an error after calling calloc function that can return with a NULL pointer if the function fails, which leads to a resultant NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: the discoverer cites this CWE-476 remark but third parties dispute the code-execution impact: \"In rare circumstances, when NULL is equivalent to the 0x0 memory address and privileged code can access it, then writing or reading memory is possible, which may lead to code execution.\"",
