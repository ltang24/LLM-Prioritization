  "Description": "An API Endpoint used by Miele's \"AppWash\" MobileApp in all versions was vulnerable to an authorization bypass. A low privileged, remote attacker would have been able to gain read and partial write access to other users data by modifying a small part of a HTTP request sent to the API. Reading or changing the password of another user was not possible, thus no impact to Availability.",
