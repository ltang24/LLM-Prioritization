  "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If `LowerBound` or `UpperBound` is given an empty`sorted_inputs` input, it results in a `nullptr` dereference, leading to a segfault that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit bce3717eaef4f769019fd18e990464ca4a2efeea. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
