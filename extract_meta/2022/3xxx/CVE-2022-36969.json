  "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of AVEVA Edge 2020 SP2 Patch 0(4201.2111.1802.0000). User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the LoadImportedLibraries method. Due to the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references, a crafted document specifying a URI causes the XML parser to access the URI and embed the contents back into the XML document for further processing. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose information in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-17394.",
