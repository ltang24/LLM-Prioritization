This issue affects Apache UIMA Apache UIMA version 3.3.0 and prior versions. Note that PEAR files should never be installed into an UIMA installation from untrusted sources because PEAR archives are executable plugins that will be able to perform any actions with the same privileges as the host Java Virtual Machine.",
