  "Updated": "2024-08-03T12:07:42.999Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19. In pxa3xx_gcu_write in drivers/video/fbdev/pxa3xx-gcu.c, the count parameter has a type conflict of size_t versus int, causing an integer overflow and bypassing the size check. After that, because it is used as the third argument to copy_from_user(), a heap overflow may occur. NOTE: the original discoverer disputes that the overflow can actually happen.",
