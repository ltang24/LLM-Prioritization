  "CVE Code": "CVE-2022-38178",
  "Published": "2022-09-21T10:15:29.078Z",
  "Updated": "2025-05-28T15:23:06.572Z",
  "Description": "By spoofing the target resolver with responses that have a malformed EdDSA signature, an attacker can trigger a small memory leak. It is possible to gradually erode available memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources.",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "In BIND 9.9.12 -> 9.9.13, 9.10.7 -> 9.10.8, 9.11.3 -> 9.16.32, 9.18.0 -> 9.18.6, versions 9.11.4-S1 -> 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.32-S1 of the BIND Supported Preview Edition, and versions 9.19.0 -> 9.19.4 of the BIND 9.19 development branch, the DNSSEC verification code for the EdDSA algorithm leaks memory when there is a signature length mismatch."
