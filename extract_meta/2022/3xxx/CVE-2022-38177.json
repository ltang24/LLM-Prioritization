  "CVE Code": "CVE-2022-38177",
  "Published": "2022-09-21T10:15:28.292Z",
  "Updated": "2025-05-28T15:23:30.627Z",
  "Description": "By spoofing the target resolver with responses that have a malformed ECDSA signature, an attacker can trigger a small memory leak. It is possible to gradually erode available memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources.",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "In BIND 9.8.4 -> 9.16.32 and versions 9.9.4-S1 -> 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.32-S1 of the BIND Supported Preview Edition, the DNSSEC verification code for the ECDSA algorithm leaks memory when there is a signature length mismatch."
