  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsrcu: Tighten cleanup_srcu_struct() GP checks\n\nCurrently, cleanup_srcu_struct() checks for a grace period in progress,\nbut it does not check for a grace period that has not yet started but\nwhich might start at any time.  Such a situation could result in a\nuse-after-free bug, so this commit adds a check for a grace period that\nis needed but not yet started to cleanup_srcu_struct().",
