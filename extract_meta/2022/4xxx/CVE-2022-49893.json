  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncxl/region: Fix cxl_region leak, cleanup targets at region delete\n\nWhen a region is deleted any targets that have been previously assigned\nto that region hold references to it. Trigger those references to\ndrop by detaching all targets at unregister_region() time.\n\nOtherwise that region object will leak as userspace has lost the ability\nto detach targets once region sysfs is torn down.",
