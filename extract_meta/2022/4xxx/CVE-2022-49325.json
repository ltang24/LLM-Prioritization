  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: add accessors to read/set tp->snd_cwnd\n\nWe had various bugs over the years with code\nbreaking the assumption that tp->snd_cwnd is greater\nthan zero.\n\nLately, syzbot reported the WARN_ON_ONCE(!tp->prior_cwnd) added\nin commit 8b8a321ff72c (\"tcp: fix zero cwnd in tcp_cwnd_reduction\")\ncan trigger, and without a repro we would have to spend\nconsiderable time finding the bug.\n\nInstead of complaining too late, we want to catch where\nand when tp->snd_cwnd is set to an illegal value.",
