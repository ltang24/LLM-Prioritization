  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntty: n_gsm: add sanity check for gsm->receive in gsm_receive_buf()\n\nA null pointer dereference can happen when attempting to access the\n\"gsm->receive()\" function in gsmld_receive_buf(). Currently, the code\nassumes that gsm->recieve is only called after MUX activation.\nSince the gsmld_receive_buf() function can be accessed without the need to\ninitialize the MUX, the gsm->receive() function will not be set and a\nNULL pointer dereference will occur.\n\nFix this by avoiding the call to \"gsm->receive()\" in case the function is\nnot initialized by adding a sanity check.\n\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n gsmld_receive_buf+0x1c2/0x2f0 drivers/tty/n_gsm.c:2861\n tiocsti drivers/tty/tty_io.c:2293 [inline]\n tty_ioctl+0xa75/0x15d0 drivers/tty/tty_io.c:2692\n vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:870 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:856 [inline]\n __x64_sys_ioctl+0x193/0x200 fs/ioctl.c:856\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:50 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0x35/0xb0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:80\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd",
