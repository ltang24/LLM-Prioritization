  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: Don't finalize CSA in IBSS mode if state is disconnected\n\nWhen we are not connected to a channel, sending channel \"switch\"\nannouncement doesn't make any sense.\n\nThe BSS list is empty in that case. This causes the for loop in\ncfg80211_get_bss() to be bypassed, so the function returns NULL\n(check line 1424 of net/wireless/scan.c), causing the WARN_ON()\nin ieee80211_ibss_csa_beacon() to get triggered (check line 500\nof net/mac80211/ibss.c), which was consequently reported on the\nsyzkaller dashboard.\n\nThus, check if we have an existing connection before generating\nthe CSA beacon in ieee80211_ibss_finish_csa().",
