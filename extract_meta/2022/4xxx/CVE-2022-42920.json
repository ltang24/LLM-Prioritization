  "CVE Code": "CVE-2022-42920",
  "Published": "2022-11-07T00:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-03T13:19:05.457Z",
  "Description": "Apache Commons BCEL has a number of APIs that would normally only allow changing specific class characteristics. However, due to an out-of-bounds writing issue, these APIs can be used to produce arbitrary bytecode. This could be abused in applications that pass attacker-controllable data to those APIs, giving the attacker more control over the resulting bytecode than otherwise expected. Update to Apache Commons BCEL 6.6.0.",
