  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5: Fix a race on command flush flow\n\nFix a refcount use after free warning due to a race on command entry.\nSuch race occurs when one of the commands releases its last refcount and\nfrees its index and entry while another process running command flush\nflow takes refcount to this command entry. The process which handles\ncommands flush may see this command as needed to be flushed if the other\nprocess released its refcount but didn't release the index yet. Fix it\nby adding the needed spin lock.\n\nIt fixes the following warning trace:\n\nrefcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.\nWARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 540311 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate+0x80/0xe0\n...\nRIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0x80/0xe0\n...\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n mlx5_cmd_trigger_completions+0x293/0x340 [mlx5_core]\n mlx5_cmd_flush+0x3a/0xf0 [mlx5_core]\n enter_error_state+0x44/0x80 [mlx5_core]\n mlx5_fw_fatal_reporter_err_work+0x37/0xe0 [mlx5_core]\n process_one_work+0x1be/0x390\n worker_thread+0x4d/0x3d0\n ? rescuer_thread+0x350/0x350\n kthread+0x141/0x160\n ? set_kthread_struct+0x40/0x40\n ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n </TASK>",
