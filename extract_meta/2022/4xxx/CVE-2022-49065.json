  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nSUNRPC: Fix the svc_deferred_event trace class\n\nFix a NULL deref crash that occurs when an svc_rqst is deferred\nwhile the sunrpc tracing subsystem is enabled. svc_revisit() sets\ndr->xprt to NULL, so it can't be relied upon in the tracepoint to\nprovide the remote's address.\n\nUnfortunately we can't revert the \"svc_deferred_class\" hunk in\ncommit ece200ddd54b (\"sunrpc: Save remote presentation address in\nsvc_xprt for trace events\") because there is now a specific check\nof event format specifiers for unsafe dereferences. The warning\nthat check emits is:\n\n  event svc_defer_recv has unsafe dereference of argument 1\n\nA \"%pISpc\" format specifier with a \"struct sockaddr *\" is indeed\nflagged by this check.\n\nInstead, take the brute-force approach used by the svcrdma_qp_error\ntracepoint. Convert the dr::addr field into a presentation address\nin the TP_fast_assign() arm of the trace event, and store that as\na string. This fix can be backported to -stable kernels.\n\nIn the meantime, commit c6ced22997ad (\"tracing: Update print fmt\ncheck to handle new __get_sockaddr() macro\") is now in v5.18, so\nthis wonky fix can be replaced with __sockaddr() and friends\nproperly during the v5.19 merge window.",
