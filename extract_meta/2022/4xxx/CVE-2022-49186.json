  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: visconti: prevent array overflow in visconti_clk_register_gates()\n\nThis code was using -1 to represent that there was no reset function.\nUnfortunately, the -1 was stored in u8 so the if (clks[i].rs_id >= 0)\ncondition was always true.  This lead to an out of bounds access in\nvisconti_clk_register_gates().",
