  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: gso: fix panic on frag_list with mixed head alloc types\n\nSince commit 3dcbdb134f32 (\"net: gso: Fix skb_segment splat when\nsplitting gso_size mangled skb having linear-headed frag_list\"), it is\nallowed to change gso_size of a GRO packet. However, that commit assumes\nthat \"checking the first list_skb member suffices; i.e if either of the\nlist_skb members have non head_frag head, then the first one has too\".\n\nIt turns out this assumption does not hold. We've seen BUG_ON being hit\nin skb_segment when skbs on the frag_list had differing head_frag with\nthe vmxnet3 driver. This happens because __netdev_alloc_skb and\n__napi_alloc_skb can return a skb that is page backed or kmalloced\ndepending on the requested size. As the result, the last small skb in\nthe GRO packet can be kmalloced.\n\nThere are three different locations where this can be fixed:\n\n(1) We could check head_frag in GRO and not allow GROing skbs with\n    different head_frag. However, that would lead to performance\n    regression on normal forward paths with unmodified gso_size, where\n    !head_frag in the last packet is not a problem.\n\n(2) Set a flag in bpf_skb_net_grow and bpf_skb_net_shrink indicating\n    that NETIF_F_SG is undesirable. That would need to eat a bit in\n    sk_buff. Furthermore, that flag can be unset when all skbs on the\n    frag_list are page backed. To retain good performance,\n    bpf_skb_net_grow/shrink would have to walk the frag_list.\n\n(3) Walk the frag_list in skb_segment when determining whether\n    NETIF_F_SG should be cleared. This of course slows things down.\n\nThis patch implements (3). To limit the performance impact in\nskb_segment, the list is walked only for skbs with SKB_GSO_DODGY set\nthat have gso_size changed. Normal paths thus will not hit it.\n\nWe could check only the last skb but since we need to walk the whole\nlist anyway, let's stay on the safe side.",
