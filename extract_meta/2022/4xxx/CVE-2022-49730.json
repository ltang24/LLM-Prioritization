  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Resolve NULL ptr dereference after an ELS LOGO is aborted\n\nA use-after-free crash can occur after an ELS LOGO is aborted.\n\nSpecifically, a nodelist structure is freed and then\nndlp->vport->cfg_log_verbose is dereferenced in lpfc_nlp_get() when the\ndiscovery state machine is mistakenly called a second time with\nNLP_EVT_DEVICE_RM argument.\n\nRework lpfc_cmpl_els_logo() to prevent the duplicate calls to release a\nnodelist structure.",
