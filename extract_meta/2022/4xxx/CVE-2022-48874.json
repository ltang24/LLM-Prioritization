  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmisc: fastrpc: Fix use-after-free and race in fastrpc_map_find\n\nCurrently, there is a race window between the point when the mutex is\nunlocked in fastrpc_map_lookup and the reference count increasing\n(fastrpc_map_get) in fastrpc_map_find, which can also lead to\nuse-after-free.\n\nSo lets merge fastrpc_map_find into fastrpc_map_lookup which allows us\nto both protect the maps list by also taking the &fl->lock spinlock and\nthe reference count, since the spinlock will be released only after.\nAdd take_ref argument to make this suitable for all callers.",
