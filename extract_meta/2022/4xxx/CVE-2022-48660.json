  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpiolib: cdev: Set lineevent_state::irq after IRQ register successfully\n\nWhen running gpio test on nxp-ls1028 platform with below command\ngpiomon --num-events=3 --rising-edge gpiochip1 25\nThere will be a warning trace as below:\nCall trace:\nfree_irq+0x204/0x360\nlineevent_free+0x64/0x70\ngpio_ioctl+0x598/0x6a0\n__arm64_sys_ioctl+0xb4/0x100\ninvoke_syscall+0x5c/0x130\n......\nel0t_64_sync+0x1a0/0x1a4\nThe reason of this issue is that calling request_threaded_irq()\nfunction failed, and then lineevent_free() is invoked to release\nthe resource. Since the lineevent_state::irq was already set, so\nthe subsequent invocation of free_irq() would trigger the above\nwarning call trace. To fix this issue, set the lineevent_state::irq\nafter the IRQ register successfully.",
