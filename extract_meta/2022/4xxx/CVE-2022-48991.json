  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/khugepaged: invoke MMU notifiers in shmem/file collapse paths\n\nAny codepath that zaps page table entries must invoke MMU notifiers to\nensure that secondary MMUs (like KVM) don't keep accessing pages which\naren't mapped anymore.  Secondary MMUs don't hold their own references to\npages that are mirrored over, so failing to notify them can lead to page\nuse-after-free.\n\nI'm marking this as addressing an issue introduced in commit f3f0e1d2150b\n(\"khugepaged: add support of collapse for tmpfs/shmem pages\"), but most of\nthe security impact of this only came in commit 27e1f8273113 (\"khugepaged:\nenable collapse pmd for pte-mapped THP\"), which actually omitted flushes\nfor the removal of present PTEs, not just for the removal of empty page\ntables.",
