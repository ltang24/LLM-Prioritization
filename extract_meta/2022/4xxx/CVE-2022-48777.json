  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmtd: parsers: qcom: Fix kernel panic on skipped partition\n\nIn the event of a skipped partition (case when the entry name is empty)\nthe kernel panics in the cleanup function as the name entry is NULL.\nRework the parser logic by first checking the real partition number and\nthen allocate the space and set the data for the valid partitions.\n\nThe logic was also fundamentally wrong as with a skipped partition, the\nparts number returned was incorrect by not decreasing it for the skipped\npartitions.",
