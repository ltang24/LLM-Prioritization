  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-audio: Drop snd_BUG_ON() from snd_usbmidi_output_open()\n\nsnd_usbmidi_output_open() has a check of the NULL port with\nsnd_BUG_ON().  snd_BUG_ON() was used as this shouldn't have happened,\nbut in reality, the NULL port may be seen when the device gives an\ninvalid endpoint setup at the descriptor, hence the driver skips the\nallocation.  That is, the check itself is valid and snd_BUG_ON()\nshould be dropped from there.  Otherwise it's confusing as if it were\na real bug, as recently syzbot stumbled on it.",
