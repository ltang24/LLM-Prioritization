  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Don't redirect packets with invalid pkt_len\n\nSyzbot found an issue [1]: fq_codel_drop() try to drop a flow whitout any\nskbs, that is, the flow->head is null.\nThe root cause, as the [2] says, is because that bpf_prog_test_run_skb()\nrun a bpf prog which redirects empty skbs.\nSo we should determine whether the length of the packet modified by bpf\nprog or others like bpf_prog_test is valid before forwarding it directly.",
