  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: buffer: Fix file related error handling in IIO_BUFFER_GET_FD_IOCTL\n\nIf we fail to copy the just created file descriptor to userland, we\ntry to clean up by putting back 'fd' and freeing 'ib'. The code uses\nput_unused_fd() for the former which is wrong, as the file descriptor\nwas already published by fd_install() which gets called internally by\nanon_inode_getfd().\n\nThis makes the error handling code leaving a half cleaned up file\ndescriptor table around and a partially destructed 'file' object,\nallowing userland to play use-after-free tricks on us, by abusing\nthe still usable fd and making the code operate on a dangling\n'file->private_data' pointer.\n\nInstead of leaving the kernel in a partially corrupted state, don't\nattempt to explicitly clean up and leave this to the process exit\npath that'll release any still valid fds, including the one created\nby the previous call to anon_inode_getfd(). Simply return -EFAULT to\nindicate the error.",
