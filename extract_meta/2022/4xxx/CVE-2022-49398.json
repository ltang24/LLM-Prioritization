  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: dwc3: gadget: Replace list_for_each_entry_safe() if using giveback\n\nThe list_for_each_entry_safe() macro saves the current item (n) and\nthe item after (n+1), so that n can be safely removed without\ncorrupting the list.  However, when traversing the list and removing\nitems using gadget giveback, the DWC3 lock is briefly released,\nallowing other routines to execute.  There is a situation where, while\nitems are being removed from the cancelled_list using\ndwc3_gadget_ep_cleanup_cancelled_requests(), the pullup disable\nroutine is running in parallel (due to UDC unbind).  As the cleanup\nroutine removes n, and the pullup disable removes n+1, once the\ncleanup retakes the DWC3 lock, it references a request who was already\nremoved/handled.  With list debug enabled, this leads to a panic.\nEnsure all instances of the macro are replaced where gadget giveback\nis used.\n\nExample call stack:\n\nThread#1:\n__dwc3_gadget_ep_set_halt() - CLEAR HALT\n  -> dwc3_gadget_ep_cleanup_cancelled_requests()\n    ->list_for_each_entry_safe()\n    ->dwc3_gadget_giveback(n)\n      ->dwc3_gadget_del_and_unmap_request()- n deleted[cancelled_list]\n      ->spin_unlock\n      ->Thread#2 executes\n      ...\n    ->dwc3_gadget_giveback(n+1)\n      ->Already removed!\n\nThread#2:\ndwc3_gadget_pullup()\n  ->waiting for dwc3 spin_lock\n  ...\n  ->Thread#1 released lock\n  ->dwc3_stop_active_transfers()\n    ->dwc3_remove_requests()\n      ->fetches n+1 item from cancelled_list (n removed by Thread#1)\n      ->dwc3_gadget_giveback()\n        ->dwc3_gadget_del_and_unmap_request()- n+1 deleted[cancelled_list]\n        ->spin_unlock",
