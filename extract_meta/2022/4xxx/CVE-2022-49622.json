  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: avoid skb access on nf_stolen\n\nWhen verdict is NF_STOLEN, the skb might have been freed.\n\nWhen tracing is enabled, this can result in a use-after-free:\n1. access to skb->nf_trace\n2. access to skb->mark\n3. computation of trace id\n4. dump of packet payload\n\nTo avoid 1, keep a cached copy of skb->nf_trace in the\ntrace state struct.\nRefresh this copy whenever verdict is != STOLEN.\n\nAvoid 2 by skipping skb->mark access if verdict is STOLEN.\n\n3 is avoided by precomputing the trace id.\n\nOnly dump the packet when verdict is not \"STOLEN\".",
