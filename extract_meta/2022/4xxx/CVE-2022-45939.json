  "Updated": "2025-04-28T18:12:24.092Z",
  "Description": "GNU Emacs through 28.2 allows attackers to execute commands via shell metacharacters in the name of a source-code file, because lib-src/etags.c uses the system C library function in its implementation of the ctags program. For example, a victim may use the \"ctags *\" command (suggested in the ctags documentation) in a situation where the current working directory has contents that depend on untrusted input.",
