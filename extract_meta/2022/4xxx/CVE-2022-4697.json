  "Updated": "2025-01-10T16:10:42.942Z",
  "Description": "The ProfilePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018wp_user_cover_default_image_url\u2019 parameter in versions up to, and including, 4.5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
