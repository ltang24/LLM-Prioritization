  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Add schedule points in batch ops\n\nsyzbot reported various soft lockups caused by bpf batch operations.\n\n INFO: task kworker/1:1:27 blocked for more than 140 seconds.\n INFO: task hung in rcu_barrier\n\nNothing prevents batch ops to process huge amount of data,\nwe need to add schedule points in them.\n\nNote that maybe_wait_bpf_programs(map) calls from\ngeneric_map_delete_batch() can be factorized by moving\nthe call after the loop.\n\nThis will be done later in -next tree once we get this fix merged,\nunless there is strong opinion doing this optimization sooner.",
