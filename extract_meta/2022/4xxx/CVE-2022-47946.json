  "Updated": "2025-04-15T13:50:55.380Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.10.x before 5.10.155. A use-after-free in io_sqpoll_wait_sq in fs/io_uring.c allows an attacker to crash the kernel, resulting in denial of service. finish_wait can be skipped. An attack can occur in some situations by forking a process and then quickly terminating it. NOTE: later kernel versions, such as the 5.15 longterm series, substantially changed the implementation of io_sqpoll_wait_sq.",
