  "Description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When `tf.raw_ops.ImageProjectiveTransformV2` is given a large output shape, it overflows. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 8faa6ea692985dbe6ce10e1a3168e0bd60a723ba. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
