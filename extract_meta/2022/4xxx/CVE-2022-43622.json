  "Description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DIR-1935 1.03 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Login requests to the web management portal. When parsing the HNAP_AUTH header, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-16139.",
