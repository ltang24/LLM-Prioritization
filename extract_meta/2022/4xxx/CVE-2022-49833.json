  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: zoned: clone zoned device info when cloning a device\n\nWhen cloning a btrfs_device, we're not cloning the associated\nbtrfs_zoned_device_info structure of the device in case of a zoned\nfilesystem.\n\nLater on this leads to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing the\ndevice's zone_info for instance when setting a zone as active.\n\nThis was uncovered by fstests' testcase btrfs/161.",
