  "Description": "Jenkins Pipeline: Input Step Plugin 451.vf1a_a_4f405289 and earlier does not restrict or sanitize the optionally specified ID of the 'input' step, which is used for the URLs that process user interactions for the given 'input' step (proceed or abort) and is not correctly encoded, allowing attackers able to configure Pipelines to have Jenkins build URLs from 'input' step IDs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL in Jenkins when the 'input' step is interacted with.",
