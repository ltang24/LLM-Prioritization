  "Description": "In certain Nedi products, a vulnerability in the web UI of NeDi login & Community login could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to affect the integrity of a device via a User Enumeration vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to insecure design, where a difference in forgot password utility could allow an attacker to determine if the user is valid or not, enabling a brute force attack with valid users. This affects NeDi 1.0.7 for OS X 1.0.7 <= and NeDi for Suse 1.0.7 <= and NeDi for FreeBSD 1.0.7 <=.",
