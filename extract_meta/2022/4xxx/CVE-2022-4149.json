  "CVE Code": "CVE-2022-4149",

  "Updated": "2024-12-12T17:05:07.261Z",
  "Description": "The Netskope client service (prior to R96) on Windows runs as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM which writes log files to a writable directory (C:\\Users\\Public\\netSkope) for a standard user. The files are created and written with a SYSTEM account except one file (logplaceholder) which inherits permission giving all users full access control list. Netskope client restricts access to this file by allowing only read permissions as a standard user. Whenever the Netskope client service restarts, it deletes the logplaceholder and recreates, creating a race condition, which can be exploited by a malicious local user to create the file and set ACL permissions on the file. Once the file is created by a malicious user with proper ACL permissions, all files within C:\\Users\\Public\\netSkope\\ becomes modifiable by the unprivileged user. By using Windows pseudo-symlink, these files can be pointed to other places in the system and thus malicious users will be able to elevate privileges.\n",
