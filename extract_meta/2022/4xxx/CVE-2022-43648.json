  "Description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DIR-3040 1.20B03 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the MiniDLNA service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the MiniDLNA service. Was ZDI-CAN-19910.",
