  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix wrong reg type conversion in release_reference()\n\nSome helper functions will allocate memory. To avoid memory leaks, the\nverifier requires the eBPF program to release these memories by calling\nthe corresponding helper functions.\n\nWhen a resource is released, all pointer registers corresponding to the\nresource should be invalidated. The verifier use release_references() to\ndo this job, by apply  __mark_reg_unknown() to each relevant register.\n\nIt will give these registers the type of SCALAR_VALUE. A register that\nwill contain a pointer value at runtime, but of type SCALAR_VALUE, which\nmay allow the unprivileged user to get a kernel pointer by storing this\nregister into a map.\n\nUsing __mark_reg_not_init() while NOT allow_ptr_leaks can mitigate this\nproblem.",
