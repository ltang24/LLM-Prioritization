  "Description": "Authentication bypass in Netcomm router models NF20MESH, NF20, and NL1902 allows an unauthenticated user to access content. In order to serve static content, the application performs a check for the existence of specific characters in the URL (.css, .png etc). If it exists, it performs a \"fake login\" to give the request an active session to load the file and not redirect to the login page.",
