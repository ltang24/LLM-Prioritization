  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: lpfc: Fix null pointer dereference after failing to issue FLOGI and PLOGI\n\nIf lpfc_issue_els_flogi() fails and returns non-zero status, the node\nreference count is decremented to trigger the release of the nodelist\nstructure. However, if there is a prior registration or dev-loss-evt work\npending, the node may be released prematurely.  When dev-loss-evt\ncompletes, the released node is referenced causing a use-after-free null\npointer dereference.\n\nSimilarly, when processing non-zero ELS PLOGI completion status in\nlpfc_cmpl_els_plogi(), the ndlp flags are checked for a transport\nregistration before triggering node removal.  If dev-loss-evt work is\npending, the node may be released prematurely and a subsequent call to\nlpfc_dev_loss_tmo_handler() results in a use after free ndlp dereference.\n\nAdd test for pending dev-loss before decrementing the node reference count\nfor FLOGI, PLOGI, PRLI, and ADISC handling.",
