  "CVE Code": "CVE-2005-3275",
  "Published": "2005-10-20T04:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-07T23:10:07.150Z",
  "Description": "The NAT code (1) ip_nat_proto_tcp.c and (2) ip_nat_proto_udp.c in Linux kernel 2.6 before 2.6.13 and 2.4 before 2.4.32-rc1 incorrectly declares a variable to be static, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) by causing two packets for the same protocol to be NATed at the same time, which leads to memory corruption.",
