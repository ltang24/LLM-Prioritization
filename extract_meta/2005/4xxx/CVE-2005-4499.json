  "Description": "The Downloadable RADIUS ACLs feature in Cisco PIX and VPN 3000 concentrators, when creating an ACL on the Cisco Secure Access Control Server (CS ACS), generates a random internal name for an ACL that is also used as a hidden user name and password, which allows remote attackers to gain privileges by sniffing the username from the cleartext portion of a RADIUS session, then using the password to log in to another device that uses CS ACS.",
