  "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the get_bhead function in readfile.c in Blender BlenLoader 2.0 through 2.40pre allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a .blend file with a negative bhead.len value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected, possibly due to an integer overflow.",
