  "Description": "Turnkey Web Tools SunShop Shopping Cart allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a phpinfo action to (1) index.php, (2) admin/index.php, and (3) admin/adminindex.php, which executes the PHP phpinfo function.  NOTE: The vendor has disputed this issue, saying that \"Having this in the code makes it easier for us to troubleshoot when issues arise on individual carts. For someone to have a script to do this type of search would require that they know where your shop is actually located. I dont think it really can be construde [sic] as a security issue.",
