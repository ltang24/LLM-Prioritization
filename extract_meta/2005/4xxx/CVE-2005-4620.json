  "Published": "2006-01-06T11:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-07T23:53:27.892Z",
  "Description": "Buffer overflow in WinRAR 3.50 and earlier allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a long command-line argument.  NOTE: because this program executes with the privileges of the invoking user, and because remote programs do not normally have the ability to specify a command-line argument for this program, there may not be a typical attack vector for the issue that crosses privilege boundaries. Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.",
