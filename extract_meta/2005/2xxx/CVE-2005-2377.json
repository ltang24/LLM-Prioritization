  "Description": "nss_ldap 181 to versions before 213, as used in Mandrake Corporate Server and Mandrake 10.0, and other operating systems, does not properly handle a SIGPIPE signal when sending a search request to an LDAP directory server, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crond and other application crash) if they can cause an LDAP server to become unavailable.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this attack scenario is sufficient to include this item in CVE.",
