  "Updated": "2024-09-16T18:14:17.488Z",
  "Description": "The file download dialog in Mozilla Firefox 0.10.1 and 1.0 for Windows uses the Content-Type HTTP header to determine the file type, but saves the original file extension when \"Save to Disk\" is selected, which allows remote attackers to hide the real file types of downloaded files.",
