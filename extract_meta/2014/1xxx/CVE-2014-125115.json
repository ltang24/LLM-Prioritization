  "Description": "An unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in Pandora FMS version 5.0 SP2 and earlier. The mobile/index.php endpoint fails to properly sanitize user input in the loginhash_data parameter, allowing attackers to extract administrator credentials or active session tokens via crafted requests. This occurs because input is directly concatenated into an SQL query without adequate validation, enabling SQL injection. After authentication is bypassed, a second vulnerability in the File Manager component permits arbitrary PHP file uploads. The file upload functionality does not enforce MIME-type or file extension restrictions, allowing authenticated users to upload web shells into a publicly accessible directory and achieve remote code execution.",
