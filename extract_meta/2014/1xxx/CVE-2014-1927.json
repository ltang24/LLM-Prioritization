  "Description": "The shell_quote function in python-gnupg 0.3.5 does not properly quote strings, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters in unspecified vectors, as demonstrated using \"$(\" command-substitution sequences, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-1928.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7323.",
