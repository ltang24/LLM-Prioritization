  "Description": "The ProfileGrid \u2013 User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to blind and time-based SQL Injections via the rid and search parameters in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.4.7 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",
