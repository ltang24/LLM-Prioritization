When supplied as user input, these secure values may be inadvertently captured in OpenTelemetry traces as part of the arguments and flags for the traced CLI command.\u00a0OpenTelemetry traces are also saved in BuildKit daemon's history records.\n\n\nThis vulnerability does not impact secrets passed to the Github cache backend\u00a0via environment variables or registry authentication.",
