  "Description": "The Homey theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.4.3. This is due to the 'verification_id' value being set to empty, and the not empty check is missing in the dashboard user profile page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in to the first verified user.",
