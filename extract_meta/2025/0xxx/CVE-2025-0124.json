  "Description": "An authenticated file deletion vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS\u00ae software enables an authenticated attacker with network access to the management web interface to delete certain files as the \u201cnobody\u201d user; this includes limited logs and configuration files but does not include system files.\n\nThe attacker must have network access to the management web interface to exploit this issue. You greatly reduce the risk of this issue by restricting access to the management web interface to only trusted internal IP addresses according to our recommended  critical deployment guidelines https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431 .\n\nThis issue affects Cloud NGFW.
