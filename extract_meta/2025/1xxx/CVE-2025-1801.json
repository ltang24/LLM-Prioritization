  "Description": "A flaw was found in the Ansible aap-gateway. Concurrent requests handled by the gateway grpc service can result in concurrency issues due to race condition requests against the proxy. This issue potentially allows a less privileged user to obtain the JWT of a greater privileged user, enabling the server to be jeopardized. A user session or confidential data might be vulnerable.",
