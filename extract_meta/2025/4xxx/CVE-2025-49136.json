  "Description": "listmonk is a standalone, self-hosted, newsletter and mailing list manager. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 5.0.2, the `env` and `expandenv` template functions which is enabled by default in Sprig enables capturing of env variables on host. While this may not be a problem on single-user (super admin) installations, on multi-user installations, this allows non-super-admin users with campaign or template permissions to use the `{{ env }}` template expression to capture sensitive environment variables. Users should upgrade to v5.0.2 to mitigate the issue.",
