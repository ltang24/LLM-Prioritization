  "Description": "Pillow is a Python imaging library. In versions 11.2.0 to before 11.3.0, there is a heap buffer overflow when writing a sufficiently large (>64k encoded with default settings) image in the DDS format due to writing into a buffer without checking for available space. This only affects users who save untrusted data as a compressed DDS image. This issue has been patched in version 11.3.0.",
