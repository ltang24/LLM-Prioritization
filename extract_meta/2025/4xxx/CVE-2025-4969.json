  "Description": "A vulnerability was found in the libsoup package. This flaw stems from its failure to correctly verify the termination of multipart HTTP messages. This can allow a remote attacker to send a specially crafted multipart HTTP body, causing the libsoup-consuming server to read beyond its allocated memory boundaries (out-of-bounds read).",
