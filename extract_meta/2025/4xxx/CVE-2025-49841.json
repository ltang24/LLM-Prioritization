  "Description": "GPT-SoVITS-WebUI is a voice conversion and text-to-speech webUI. In versions 20250228v3 and prior, there is an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in process_ckpt.py. The SoVITS_dropdown variable takes user input and passes it to the load_sovits_new function in process_ckpt.py. In load_sovits_new, the user input, here sovits_path is used to load a model with torch.load, leading to unsafe deserialization. At time of publication, no known patched versions are available.",
