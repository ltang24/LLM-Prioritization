  "Description": "lunary-ai/lunary versions prior to 1.9.24 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the `v1/runs/ingest` endpoint by adding an empty `citations` field, triggering a code path where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to render attacker-controlled text. This vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
