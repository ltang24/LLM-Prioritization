  "Description": "In some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions through to 2.4.63, an HTTP desynchronisation attack allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to hijack an HTTP session via a TLS upgrade.\n\nOnly configurations using \"SSLEngine optional\" to enable TLS upgrades are affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64, which removes support for TLS upgrade.",
