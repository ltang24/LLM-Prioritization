  "Description": "The NEX-Forms \u2013 Ultimate Form Builder \u2013 Contact forms and much more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Limited Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 8.9.1 via the get_table_records function. This is due to the unsanitized use of user-supplied input in call_user_func(). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Custom-level access, to execute arbitrary PHP functions that meet specific constraints (static methods or global functions accepting a single array parameter).",
