  "Description": "Lack of input validation/sanitization in the 'setLanCfg' API endpoint in httpd in the Tenda RX2 Pro 16.03.30.14 allows a remote attacker that is authorized to the web management portal to gain root shell access to the device by sending a crafted web request. This is persistent because the command injection is saved in the configuration of the device.",
