  "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows agent component of SecureConnector\u00a0due to improper access controls on a named pipe. The pipe is accessible to the Everyone group and does not restrict remote connections, allowing any network-based attacker to connect without authentication. By interacting with this pipe, an attacker can redirect the agent to communicate with a rogue server that can issue commands via the SecureConnector Agent.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis does not impact Linux or OSX Secure Connector.",
