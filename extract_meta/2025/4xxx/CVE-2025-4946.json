  "Updated": "2025-07-02T13:14:28.922Z",
  "Description": "The Vikinger theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the vikinger_delete_activity_media_ajax() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.32. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). Note: Requires Vikinger Media plugin to be installed and active.",
