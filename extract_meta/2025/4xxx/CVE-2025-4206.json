  "Updated": "2025-05-09T16:10:24.557Z",
  "Description": "The WordPress CRM, Email & Marketing Automation for WordPress | Award Winner \u2014 Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'process_export_delete' and 'process_import_delete' functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).",
