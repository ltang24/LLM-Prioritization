  "Description": "Zulip is an open-source team chat application. Starting in version 10.0 and prior to version 10.3, the \"Who can create public channels\" access control mechanism can be circumvented by creating a private or web-public channel, and then changing the channel privacy to public. A similar technique works for creating private channels without permission, though such a process requires either the API or modifying the HTML, as we do mark the \"private\" radio button as disabled in such cases. Version 10.3 contains a patch.",
