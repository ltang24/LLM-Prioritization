  "Description": "Langroid is a Python framework to build large language model (LLM)-powered applications. Prior to version 0.53.15, `TableChatAgent` uses `pandas eval()`. If fed by untrusted user input, like the case of a public-facing LLM application, it may be vulnerable to code injection. Langroid 0.53.15 sanitizes input to `TableChatAgent` by default to tackle the most common attack vectors, and added several warnings about the risky behavior in the project documentation.",
