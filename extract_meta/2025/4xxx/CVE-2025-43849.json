  "Description": "Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI is a voice changing framework based on VITS. Versions 2.2.231006 and prior are vulnerable to unsafe deserialization. The\u00a0ckpt_a\u00a0and\u00a0cpkt_b\u00a0variables take user input\u00a0(e.g. a path to a model) and\u00a0pass\u00a0it to the\u00a0merge\u00a0function in\u00a0process_ckpt.py, which uses them to\u00a0load the models on those paths with\u00a0torch.load, which can lead to unsafe deserialization and remote code execution. As of time of publication, no known patches exist.",
