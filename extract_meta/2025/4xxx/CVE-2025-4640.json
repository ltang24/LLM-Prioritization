  "Description": "Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in PointCloudLibrary pcl allows Overflow Buffers. Since version 1.14.0, PCL by default uses a zlib installation from the system, unless the user sets WITH_SYSTEM_ZLIB=FALSE. So this potential vulnerability is only relevant if the PCL version is older than 1.14.0 or the user specifically requests to not use the system zlib.",
