  "Description": "matrix-rust-sdk is an implementation of a Matrix client-server library in Rust. matrix-sdk-crypto since version 0.8.0 and up to 0.11.0 does not correctly validate the sender of an encrypted event. Accordingly, a malicious homeserver operator can modify events served to clients, making those events appear to the recipient as if they were sent by another user.
