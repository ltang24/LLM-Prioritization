  "Description": "The MQTT add-on of PcVue fails to verify that a remote device\u2019s certificate has not already expired or has not yet become valid. This allows malicious devices to present certificates that are not rejected properly.\n\nThe use of a client certificate reduces the risk for random devices to take advantage of this flaw.",
