  "Updated": "2025-07-23T17:19:32.729Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in CommScope Ruckus Unleashed prior to 200.15.6.212.27 and 200.18.7.1.323, and in Ruckus ZoneDirector prior to 10.5.1.0.282, where an authenticated request to the management endpoint `/admin/_cmdstat.jsp` discloses the administrator password in a trivially reversible obfuscated form. The same obfuscation method persists in configuration prior to 200.18.7.1.302, allowing anyone who obtains the system configuration to recover the plaintext credentials.",
