  "Description": "A flaw was found in the authentication enforcement mechanism of a model inference API in ai-inference-server. All /v1/* endpoints are expected to enforce API key validation. However, the POST /invocations endpoint failed to do so, resulting in an authentication bypass. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to access the same inference features available on protected endpoints, potentially exposing sensitive functionality or allowing unintended access to backend resources.",
