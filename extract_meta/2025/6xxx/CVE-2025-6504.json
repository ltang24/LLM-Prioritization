  "Description": "In HDP Server versions below 4.6.2.2978 on Linux, unauthorized access could occur via IP spoofing using the X-Forwarded-For header.\u00a0\n\nSince XFF is a client-controlled header, it could be spoofed, allowing unauthorized access if the spoofed IP matched a whitelisted range.\n\n\nThis vulnerability could be exploited to bypass IP restrictions, though valid user credentials would still be required for resource access.",
