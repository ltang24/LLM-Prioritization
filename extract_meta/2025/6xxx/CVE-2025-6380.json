  "Description": "The ONLYOFFICE Docs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization within its oo.callback REST endpoint in versions 1.1.0 to 2.2.0. The plugin\u2019s permission callback only verifies that the supplied, encrypted attachment ID maps to an existing attachment post, but does not verify the requester\u2019s identity or capabilities. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as an arbitrary user.",
