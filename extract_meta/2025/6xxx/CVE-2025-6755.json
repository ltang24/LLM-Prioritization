  "Updated": "2025-06-30T18:32:53.491Z",
  "Description": "The Game Users Share Buttons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the ajaxDeleteTheme() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This makes it possible for Subscriber-level attackers to add arbitrary file paths (such as ../../../../wp-config.php) to the themeNameId parameter of the AJAX request, which can lead to remote code execution.",
