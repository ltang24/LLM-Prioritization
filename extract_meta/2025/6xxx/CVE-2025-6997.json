  "Description": "The ThemeREX Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 2.35.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The plugin\u2019s SVG rendering routine calls the trx_addons_get_svg_from_file() function on an unvalidated 'svg' parameter supplied via the shortcode or Elementor widget settings, then outputs it via the trx_addons_show_layout() function.  Because there is no check on the URL\u2019s origin, scheme, or the SVG content itself, authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, can supply a remote SVG and inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.",
