  "Updated": "2025-07-16T14:40:19.407Z",
  "Description": "The Ultimate WP Mail plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to improper authorization within the get_email_log_details() AJAX handler in versions 1.0.17 to 1.3.6. The handler reads the client-supplied post_id and retrieves the corresponding email log post content (including the password-reset link), relying only on the \u2018edit_posts\u2019 capability without restricting to administrators or validating ownership. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to harvest an admin\u2019s reset link and elevate their privileges to administrator.",
