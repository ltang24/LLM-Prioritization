  "Description": "The Easy restaurant menu manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's nsc_eprm_menu_link shortcode in versions up to, and including 2.0.1, due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
