  "Description": "A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Institute-of-Current-Students v1.0 via the email parameter in the /postquerypublic endpoint. The application fails to properly sanitize user input before reflecting it in the HTML response. This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser by tricking them into visiting a crafted URL or submitting a malicious form. Successful exploitation may lead to session hijacking, credential theft, or other client-side attacks.",
