  "Description": "The Janssen Project is an open-source identity and access management (IAM) platform. Prior to version 1.8.0, the Config API returns results without scope verification. This has a large internal surface attack area that exposes all sorts of information from the IDP including clients, users, scripts ..etc. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.0. A workaround for this vulnerability involves users forking and building the config api, patching it in their system following commit 92eea4d.",
