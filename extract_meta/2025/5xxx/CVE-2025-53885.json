  "Description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows to handle CRUD events for users it is possible to log the incoming data to console using the \"Log to Console\" operation and a template string. Malicious admins can log sensitive data from other users when they are created or updated. Version 11.9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid logging sensitive data to the console outside the context of development.",
