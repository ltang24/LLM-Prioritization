  "Updated": "2025-07-03T14:00:39.195Z",
  "Description": "The Migration, Backup, Staging \u2013 WPvivid Backup & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'wpvivid_upload_import_files' function in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.116. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE: Uploaded files are only accessible on WordPress instances running on the NGINX web server as the existing .htaccess within the target file upload folder prevents access on Apache servers.",
