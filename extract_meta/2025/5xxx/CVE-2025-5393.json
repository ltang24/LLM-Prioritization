  "Updated": "2025-07-15T19:48:30.175Z",
  "Description": "The Alone \u2013 Charity Multipurpose Non-profit WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the alone_import_pack_restore_data() function in all versions up to, and including, 7.8.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).",
