A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in emlog up to and including pro-2.5.17 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the keyword parameter. Due to lack of sanitization it is possible to inject HTML/JS code into keyword parameter. If one persuades an user into clicking into prepared link it is possible to execute any JS code in admin's browser. As of time of publication, no known patched versions exist.",
