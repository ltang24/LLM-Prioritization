  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: iwlwifi: mld: avoid panic on init failure\n\nIn case of an error during init, in_hw_restart will be set, but it will\nnever get cleared.\nInstead, we will retry to init again, and then we will act like we are in a\nrestart when we are actually not.\n\nThis causes (among others) to a NULL pointer dereference when canceling\nrx_omi::finished_work, that was not even initialized, because we thought\nthat we are in hw_restart.\n\nSet in_hw_restart to true only if the fw is running, then we know that\nFW was loaded successfully and we are not going to the retry loop.",
