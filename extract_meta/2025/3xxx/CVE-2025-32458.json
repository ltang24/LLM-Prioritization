This is an instance of CWE-88, \"Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection'),\" and is estimated as a CVSS 7.7 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).\nThis issue affects Quantenna Wi-Fi chipset through version 8.0.0.28 of the latest SDK, and appears to be unpatched at the time of this CVE record's first publishing, though the vendor has released a best practices guide for implementors of this chipset.",
