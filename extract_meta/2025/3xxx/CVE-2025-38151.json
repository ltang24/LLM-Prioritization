  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/cma: Fix hang when cma_netevent_callback fails to queue_work\n\nThe cited commit fixed a crash when cma_netevent_callback was called for\na cma_id while work on that id from a previous call had not yet started.\nThe work item was re-initialized in the second call, which corrupted the\nwork item currently in the work queue.\n\nHowever, it left a problem when queue_work fails (because the item is\nstill pending in the work queue from a previous call). In this case,\ncma_id_put (which is called in the work handler) is therefore not\ncalled. This results in a userspace process hang (zombie process).\n\nFix this by calling cma_id_put() if queue_work fails.",
