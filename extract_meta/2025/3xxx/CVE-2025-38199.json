  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: Fix memory leak due to multiple rx_stats allocation\n\nrx_stats for each arsta is allocated when adding a station.\narsta->rx_stats will be freed when a station is removed.\n\nRedundant allocations are occurring when the same station is added\nmultiple times. This causes ath12k_mac_station_add() to be called\nmultiple times, and rx_stats is allocated each time. As a result there\nis memory leaks.\n\nPrevent multiple allocations of rx_stats when ath12k_mac_station_add()\nis called repeatedly by checking if rx_stats is already allocated\nbefore allocating again. Allocate arsta->rx_stats if arsta->rx_stats\nis NULL respectively.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1\nTested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3",
