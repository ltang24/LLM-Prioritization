  "Description": "The Forminator Forms \u2013 Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Order Replay in all versions up to, and including, 1.42.0 via the 'handle_stripe_single' function due to insufficient validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reuse a single Stripe PaymentIntent for multiple transactions. Only the first transaction is processed via Stripe, but the plugin sends a successful email message for each transaction, which may trick an administrator into fulfilling each order.",
