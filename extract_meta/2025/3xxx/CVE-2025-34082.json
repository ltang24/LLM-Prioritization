  "Description": "A command injection vulnerability exists in IGEL OS versions prior to 11.04.270 within the Secure Terminal and Secure Shadow services. The flaw arises due to improper input sanitization in the handling of specially crafted PROXYCMD commands on TCP ports 30022 and 5900. An unauthenticated attacker with network access to a vulnerable device can inject arbitrary commands, leading to remote code execution with elevated privileges.\n\nNOTE: IGEL OS v10.x has reached end-of-life (EOL) status.",
