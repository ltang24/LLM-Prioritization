  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/fdinfo: grab ctx->uring_lock around io_uring_show_fdinfo()\n\nNot everything requires locking in there, which is why the 'has_lock'\nvariable exists. But enough does that it's a bit unwieldy to manage.\nWrap the whole thing in a ->uring_lock trylock, and just return\nwith no output if we fail to grab it. The existing trylock() will\nalready have greatly diminished utility/output for the failure case.\n\nThis fixes an issue with reading the SQE fields, if the ring is being\nactively resized at the same time.",
