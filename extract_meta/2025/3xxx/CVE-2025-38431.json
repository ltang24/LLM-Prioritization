  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmb: client: fix regression with native SMB symlinks\n\nSome users and customers reported that their backup/copy tools started\nto fail when the directory being copied contained symlink targets that\nthe client couldn't parse - even when those symlinks weren't followed.\n\nFix this by allowing lstat(2) and readlink(2) to succeed even when the\nclient can't resolve the symlink target, restoring old behavior.",
