  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe/vm: move xe_svm_init() earlier\n\nIn xe_vm_close_and_put() we need to be able to call xe_svm_fini(),\nhowever during vm creation we can call this on the error path, before\nhaving actually initialised the svm state, leading to various splats\nfollowed by a fatal NPD.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 4f296d77cf49fcb5f90b4674123ad7f3a0676165)",
