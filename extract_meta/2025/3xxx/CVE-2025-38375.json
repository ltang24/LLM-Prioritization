  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvirtio-net: ensure the received length does not exceed allocated size\n\nIn xdp_linearize_page, when reading the following buffers from the ring,\nwe forget to check the received length with the true allocate size. This\ncan lead to an out-of-bound read. This commit adds that missing check.",
