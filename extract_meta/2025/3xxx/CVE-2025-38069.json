  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: endpoint: pci-epf-test: Fix double free that causes kernel to oops\n\nFix a kernel oops found while testing the stm32_pcie Endpoint driver\nwith handling of PERST# deassertion:\n\nDuring EP initialization, pci_epf_test_alloc_space() allocates all BARs,\nwhich are further freed if epc_set_bar() fails (for instance, due to no\nfree inbound window).\n\nHowever, when pci_epc_set_bar() fails, the error path:\n\n  pci_epc_set_bar() ->\n    pci_epf_free_space()\n\ndoes not clear the previous assignment to epf_test->reg[bar].\n\nThen, if the host reboots, the PERST# deassertion restarts the BAR\nallocation sequence with the same allocation failure (no free inbound\nwindow), creating a double free situation since epf_test->reg[bar] was\ndeallocated and is still non-NULL.\n\nThus, make sure that pci_epf_alloc_space() and pci_epf_free_space()\ninvocations are symmetric, and as such, set epf_test->reg[bar] to NULL\nwhen memory is freed.\n\n[kwilczynski: commit log]",
