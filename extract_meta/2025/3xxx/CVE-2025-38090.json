  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrivers/rapidio/rio_cm.c: prevent possible heap overwrite\n\nIn\n\nriocm_cdev_ioctl(RIO_CM_CHAN_SEND)\n   -> cm_chan_msg_send()\n      -> riocm_ch_send()\n\ncm_chan_msg_send() checks that userspace didn't send too much data but\nriocm_ch_send() failed to check that userspace sent sufficient data.  The\nresult is that riocm_ch_send() can write to fields in the rio_ch_chan_hdr\nwhich were outside the bounds of the space which cm_chan_msg_send()\nallocated.\n\nAddress this by teaching riocm_ch_send() to check that the entire\nrio_ch_chan_hdr was copied in from userspace.",
