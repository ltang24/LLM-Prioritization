  "Description": "OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management application. A logging oversight in versions prior to 7.0.3.4 allows password change events to go unrecorded on the client-side log viewer, preventing administrators from auditing critical actions. This weakens traceability and opens the system to undetectable misuse by insiders or attackers. Version 7.0.3.4 contains a patch for the issue.",
