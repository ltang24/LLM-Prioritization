  "Description": "The WordPress Comments Import & Export plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the save_settings function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.3. Additionally, the plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape FTP settings parameters. \r\nThis makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts on the plugin settings page that will execute whenever an administrative user accesses an injected page.\r\nThe vulnerability was partially fixed in version 2.4.3 and fully fixed in version 2.4.4",
