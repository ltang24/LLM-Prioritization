  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/dwc_pcie: fix duplicate pci_dev devices\n\nDuring platform_device_register, wrongly using struct device\npci_dev as platform_data caused a kmemdup copy of pci_dev. Worse\nstill, accessing the duplicated device leads to list corruption as its\nmutex content (e.g., list, magic) remains the same as the original.",
