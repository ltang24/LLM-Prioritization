  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: Avoid memory leak while enabling statistics\n\nDriver uses monitor destination rings for extended statistics mode and\nstandalone monitor mode. In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed from\nthe buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the\nppdu_info structure to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor\nmode, along with per-packet statistics, the packet data (payload) is\ncaptured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211.\n\nWhen the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is\nactivated. As part of enabling monitor rings for collecting statistics,\nthe driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in the filter\nconfiguration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and\nkzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a\nmemory leak. The kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object is only required while\nenabling the standalone monitor interface. This causes a memory leak while\nenabling extended statistics mode in the driver.\n\nFix this memory leak by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in\nthe HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling. Additionally, remove the standalone\nmonitor mode handlings in the HAL_MON_BUF_ADDR and HAL_RX_MSDU_END TLVs.\nThese TLV tags will be handled properly when enabling standalone monitor\nmode in the future.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1\nTested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3",
