  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: mops: Do not dereference src reg for a set operation\n\nThe source register is not used for SET* and reading it can result in\na UBSAN out-of-bounds array access error, specifically when the MOPS\nexception is taken from a SET* sequence with XZR (reg 31) as the\nsource. Architecturally this is the only case where a src/dst/size\nfield in the ESR can be reported as 31.\n\nPrior to 2de451a329cf662b the code in do_el0_mops() was benign as the\nuse of pt_regs_read_reg() prevented the out-of-bounds access.",
