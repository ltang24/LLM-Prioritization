  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-audio: Kill timer properly at removal\n\nThe USB-audio MIDI code initializes the timer, but in a rare case, the\ndriver might be freed without the disconnect call.  This leaves the\ntimer in an active state while the assigned object is released via\nsnd_usbmidi_free(), which ends up with a kernel warning when the debug\nconfiguration is enabled, as spotted by fuzzer.\n\nFor avoiding the problem, put timer_shutdown_sync() at\nsnd_usbmidi_free(), so that the timer can be killed properly.\nWhile we're at it, replace the existing timer_delete_sync() at the\ndisconnect callback with timer_shutdown_sync(), too.",
