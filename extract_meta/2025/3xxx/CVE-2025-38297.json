  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPM: EM: Fix potential division-by-zero error in em_compute_costs()\n\nWhen the device is of a non-CPU type, table[i].performance won't be\ninitialized in the previous em_init_performance(), resulting in division\nby zero when calculating costs in em_compute_costs().\n\nSince the 'cost' algorithm is only used for EAS energy efficiency\ncalculations and is currently not utilized by other device drivers, we\nshould add the _is_cpu_device(dev) check to prevent this division-by-zero\nissue.",
