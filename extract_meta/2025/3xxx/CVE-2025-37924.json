  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix use-after-free in kerberos authentication\n\nSetting sess->user = NULL was introduced to fix the dangling pointer\ncreated by ksmbd_free_user. However, it is possible another thread could\nbe operating on the session and make use of sess->user after it has been\npassed to ksmbd_free_user but before sess->user is set to NULL.",
