  "Description": "The Amazon Q Developer Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension v1.84.0 contains inert, injected code designed to call the Q Developer CLI. The code executes when the extension is launched within the VS Code environment; however the injected code contains a syntax error which prevents it from making a successful API call to the Q Developer CLI.\n\n\n\nTo mitigate this issue, users should upgrade to version v1.85.0. All installations of v1.84.0 should be removed from use.",
