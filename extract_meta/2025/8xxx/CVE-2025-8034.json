  "Description": "Memory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 115.25, Firefox ESR 128.12, Thunderbird ESR 128.12, Firefox ESR 140.0, Thunderbird ESR 140.0, Firefox 140 and Thunderbird 140. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 141, Firefox ESR < 115.26, Firefox ESR < 128.13, Firefox ESR < 140.1, Thunderbird < 141, Thunderbird < 128.13, and Thunderbird < 140.1.",
