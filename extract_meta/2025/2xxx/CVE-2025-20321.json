  "Description": "In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.3, 9.3.5, 9.2.7 and 9.1.10, and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.3.2411.104, 9.3.2408.114, and 9.2.2406.119, an unauthenticated attacker can send a specially-crafted SPL search that could change the membership state in a Splunk Search Head Cluster (SHC) through a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), potentially leading to the removal of the captain or a member of the SHC.<br><br>The vulnerability requires the attacker to phish the administrator-level victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser. The attacker should not be able to exploit the vulnerability at will.",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request."
