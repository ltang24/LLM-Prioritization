  "Description": "RAGFlow is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine based on deep document understanding. An authenticated user can exploit the Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability that may lead to unauthorized cross-tenant access (list tenant user accounts, add user account into other tenant). Unauthorized cross-tenant access: list user from other tenant (e.g., via GET /<tenant_id>/user/list), add user account to other tenant (POST /<tenant_id>/user). This issue has not yet been patched. Users are advised to reach out to the project maintainers to coordinate a fix.",
