  "Description": "The Versa Director SD-WAN orchestration platform provides direct web-based access to uCPE virtual machines through the Director GUI. By default, the websockify service is exposed on port 6080 and accessible from the internet. This exposure introduces significant risk, as websockify has known weaknesses that can be exploited, potentially leading to remote code execution. \r\n\r\nVersa Networks is not aware of any reported instance where this vulnerability was exploited. Proof of concept for this vulnerability has been disclosed by third party security researchers.  \r\n\r\nWorkarounds or Mitigation: \r\n\r\nRestrict access to TCP port 6080 if uCPE console access is not necessary. Versa recommends that Director be upgraded to one of the remediated software versions.",
