  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nfnetlink_queue: Initialize ctx to avoid memory allocation error\n\nIt is possible that ctx in nfqnl_build_packet_message() could be used\nbefore it is properly initialize, which is only initialized\nby nfqnl_get_sk_secctx().\n\nThis patch corrects this problem by initializing the lsmctx to a safe\nvalue when it is declared.\n\nThis is similar to the commit 35fcac7a7c25\n(\"audit: Initialize lsmctx to avoid memory allocation error\").",
