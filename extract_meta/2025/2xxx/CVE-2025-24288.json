  "Description": "The Versa Director software exposes a number of services by default and allow attackers an easy foothold due to default credentials and multiple accounts (most with sudo access) that utilize the same default credentials. By default, Versa director exposes ssh and postgres to the internet, alongside a host of other services.\r\n\r\nVersa Networks is not aware of any reported instance where this vulnerability was exploited. Proof of concept for this vulnerability has been disclosed by third party security researchers.  \r\n\r\nWorkarounds or Mitigation: \r\n\r\nVersa recommends the following  security controls:\r\n\r\n1) Change default passwords to complex passwords\r\n2) Passwords must be complex with at least 8 characters that comprise of upper case, and lower case alphabets,  as well as at at least one digit, and one special character\r\n3) Passwords must be changed at least every 90 days\r\n4) Password change history is checked to ensure that the at least the last 5 passwords must be used when changing password.\r\n5) Review and audit logs for all authentication attempts to check for unauthorized/suspicious login attempts and enforce remediation steps.",
