  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nregulator: dummy: force synchronous probing\n\nSometimes I get a NULL pointer dereference at boot time in kobject_get()\nwith the following call stack:\n\nanatop_regulator_probe()\n devm_regulator_register()\n  regulator_register()\n   regulator_resolve_supply()\n    kobject_get()\n\nBy placing some extra BUG_ON() statements I could verify that this is\nraised because probing of the 'dummy' regulator driver is not completed\n('dummy_regulator_rdev' is still NULL).\n\nIn the JTAG debugger I can see that dummy_regulator_probe() and\nanatop_regulator_probe() can be run by different kernel threads\n(kworker/u4:*).  I haven't further investigated whether this can be\nchanged or if there are other possibilities to force synchronization\nbetween these two probe routines.  On the other hand I don't expect much\nboot time penalty by probing the 'dummy' regulator synchronously.",
