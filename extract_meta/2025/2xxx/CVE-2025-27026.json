  "Description": "A missing double-check feature in the WebGUI for CLI deactivation in Infinera G42 \nversion R6.1.3 allows an authenticated administrator to make other \nmanagement interfaces unavailable via local and network interfaces. The CLI deactivation via the WebGUI does not only stop CLI interface but deactivates also Linux Shell, WebGUI and Physical Serial Console access. No \nconfirmation is asked at deactivation time. Loosing access to these services device administrators are at risk of completely loosing device control.",
