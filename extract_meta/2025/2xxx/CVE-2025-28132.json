  "Description": "A session management flaw in Nagios Network Analyzer 2024R1.0.3 allows an attacker to reuse session tokens even after a user logs out, leading to unauthorized access and account takeover. This occurs due to insufficient session expiration, where session tokens remain valid beyond logout, allowing an attacker to impersonate users and perform actions on their behalf.",
