  "Description": "A vulnerability in the IP Access Restriction feature of Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE-PIC could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured IP access restrictions and log in to the device from a disallowed IP address.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper enforcement of access controls that are configured using the IP Access Restriction feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the API from an unauthorized source IP address. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to the targeted device from an IP address that should have been restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.",
