  "Description": "FastGPT is a knowledge-based platform built on the LLMs. Since the web crawling plug-in does not perform intranet IP verification, an attacker can initiate an intranet IP request, causing the system to initiate a request through the intranet and potentially obtain some private data on the intranet. This issue is fixed in 4.9.0.",
