  "Description": "Rufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives. A DLL hijacking vulnerability in Rufus 4.6.2208 and earlier versions allows an attacker loading and executing a malicious DLL with escalated privileges (since the executable has been granted higher privileges during the time of launch) due to the ability to inject a malicious `cfgmgr32.dll` in the same directory as the executable and have it side load automatically. This is fixed in commit `74dfa49`, which will be part of version 4.7. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as version 4.7 becomes available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
