  "Description": "Sending a crafted SOAP \"set\" operation message within the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) internal Radio Access Network (RAN) management network can cause Nokia Single RAN baseband OAM service component restart with software versions earlier than release 24R1-SR 1.0 MP. This issue has been corrected to release 24R1-SR 1.0 MP and later.\n\nThe OAM service component restarts automatically after the stack overflow without causing a base station restart or network service degradation, and without leaving any permanent impact on the Nokia Single RAN baseband OAM service.",
