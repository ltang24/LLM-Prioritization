  "Updated": "2025-02-28T11:03:57.914Z",
  "Description": "In versions 1.0.67 and lower of the Splunk App for SOAR, the Splunk documentation for that app recommended adding the `admin_all_objects` capability to the `splunk_app_soar` role. This addition could lead to improper access control for a low-privileged user that does not hold the \"admin\"  Splunk roles.",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "The software does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor."
