  "Description": "The AuthPolicy metadata on Red Hat Connectivity Link contains an object which stores secretes, however it assumes those secretes are already in the kuadrant-system instead of copying it to the referred namespace. This creates space for a malicious actor with a developer persona access to leak those secrets over HTTP connection, as long the attacker knows the name of the targeted secrets and those secrets are limited to one line only.",

    "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
