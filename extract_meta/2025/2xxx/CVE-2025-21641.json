  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: sysctl: blackhole timeout: avoid using current->nsproxy\n\nAs mentioned in the previous commit, using the 'net' structure via\n'current' is not recommended for different reasons:\n\n- Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only\n  from the opener's netns.\n\n- current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an 'Oops'\n  (null-ptr-deref), e.g. when the current task is exiting, as spotted by\n  syzbot [1] using acct(2).\n\nThe 'pernet' structure can be obtained from the table->data using\ncontainer_of().",
