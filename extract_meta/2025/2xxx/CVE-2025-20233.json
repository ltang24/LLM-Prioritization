  "Description": "In the Splunk App for Lookup File Editing versions below 4.0.5, a script in the app used the `chmod` and `makedirs` Python functions in a way that resulted in overly broad read and execute permissions. This could lead to improper access control for a low-privileged user.",

    "The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors."
