  "Description": "In wolfSSL release 5.8.2 blinding support is turned on by default for Curve25519 in applicable builds. The blinding configure option is only for the base C implementation of Curve25519. It is not needed, or available with; ARM assembly builds, Intel assembly builds, and the small Curve25519 feature. While the side-channel attack on extracting a private key would be very difficult to execute in practice, enabling blinding provides an additional layer of protection for devices that may be more susceptible to physical access or side-channel observation.",
