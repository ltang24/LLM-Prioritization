  "Description": "The Portfolio for Elementor & Image Gallery | PowerFolio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Custom JS Attributes of Plugin's widgets in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\r\nThe issue was partially fixed in version 3.2.0 and fully fixed in version 3.2.1",
