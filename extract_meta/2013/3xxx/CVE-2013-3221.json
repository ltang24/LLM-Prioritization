  "CVE Code": "CVE-2013-3221",

  "Updated": "2024-08-06T16:00:10.162Z",
  "Description": "The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x, 3.0.x, 3.1.x, and 3.2.x does not ensure that the declared data type of a database column is used during comparisons of input values to stored values in that column, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct data-type injection attacks against Ruby on Rails applications via a crafted value, as demonstrated by unintended interaction between the \"typed XML\" feature and a MySQL database.",
