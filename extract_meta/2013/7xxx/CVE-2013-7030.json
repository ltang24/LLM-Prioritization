  "Updated": "2024-10-29T14:20:36.369Z",
  "Description": "The TFTP service in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (aka CUCM or Unified CM) allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from a phone via an RRQ operation, as demonstrated by discovering a cleartext UseUserCredential field in an SPDefault.cnf.xml file.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly disputes the significance of this report, stating that this is an expected default behavior, and that the product's documentation describes use of the TFTP Encrypted Config option in addressing this issue",
