  "CVE Code": "CVE-2013-7397",
  "Published": "2015-06-24T16:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-06T18:09:16.606Z",
  "Description": "Async Http Client (aka AHC or async-http-client) before 1.9.0 skips X.509 certificate verification unless both a keyStore location and a trustStore location are explicitly set, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof HTTPS servers by presenting an arbitrary certificate during use of a typical AHC configuration, as demonstrated by a configuration that does not send client certificates.",
