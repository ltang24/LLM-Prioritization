  "Description": "Rockwell Automation RSLinx Enterprise Software (LogReceiver.exe) CPR9, CPR9-SR1, CPR9-SR2, CPR9-SR3, CPR9-SR4, CPR9-SR5, CPR9-SR5.1, and CPR9-SR6 does not handle input correctly and results in a logic error if it calculates an incorrect value for the \u201cTotal Record Size\u201d field. By sending a datagram to the service over Port 4444/UDP with the \u201cRecord Data Size\u201d field modified to a specifically oversized value, the service will calculate an undersized value for the \u201cTotal Record Size\u201d that will cause an out-of-bounds read access violation that leads to a service crash. The service can be recovered with a manual reboot.
