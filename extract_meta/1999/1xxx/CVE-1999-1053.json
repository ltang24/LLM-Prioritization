  "Description": "guestbook.pl cleanses user-inserted SSI commands by removing text between \"<!--\" and \"-->\" separators, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands when guestbook.pl is run on Apache 1.3.9 and possibly other versions, since Apache allows other closing sequences besides \"-->\".",
