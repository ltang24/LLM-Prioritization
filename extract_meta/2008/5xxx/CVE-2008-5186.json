  "Updated": "2024-08-07T10:40:17.350Z",
  "Description": "The set_language_path function in geshi.php in Generic Syntax Highlighter (GeSHi) before 1.0.8.1 might allow remote attackers to conduct file inclusion attacks via crafted inputs that influence the default language path ($path variable).  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a vendor, stating that only a static value is used, so this is not a vulnerability in GeSHi. Separate CVE identifiers would be created for web applications that integrate GeSHi in a way that allows control of the default language path",
