  "CVE Code": "CVE-2008-5825",
  "Published": "2009-01-02T19:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-07T11:04:44.699Z",
  "Description": "The SmartPoster implementation on the Nokia 6131 Near Field Communication (NFC) phone with 05.12 firmware does not properly display the URI record when the Title record contains a certain combination of space, CR (aka \\r), and . (dot) characters, which allows remote attackers to trick a user into loading an arbitrary URI via a crafted NDEF tag, as demonstrated by (1) an http: URI for a malicious web site, (2) a tel: URI for a premium-rate telephone number, and (3) an sms: URI that triggers purchase of a ringtone.",
