  "Published": "2009-01-20T16:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-07T11:13:13.167Z",
  "Description": "An unspecified function in the JavaScript implementation in Microsoft Internet Explorer creates and exposes a \"temporary footprint\" when there is a current login to a web site, which makes it easier for remote attackers to trick a user into acting upon a spoofed pop-up message, aka an \"in-session phishing attack.\" NOTE: as of 20090116, the only disclosure is a vague pre-advisory with no actionable information. However, because it is from a well-known researcher, it is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.",
