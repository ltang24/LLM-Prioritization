  "Description": "Simple Machines Forum (SMF), probably 1.1.4, relies on \"randomly generated static\" to hinder brute-force attacks on the WAV file (aka audio) CAPTCHA, which allows remote attackers to pass the CAPTCHA test via an automated attack that considers Hamming distances.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an insufficient fix for CVE-2007-3308.",
