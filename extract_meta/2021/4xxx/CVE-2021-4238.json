  "Updated": "2025-04-11T16:17:46.299Z",
  "Description": "Randomly-generated alphanumeric strings contain significantly less entropy than expected. The RandomAlphaNumeric and CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric functions always return strings containing at least one digit from 0 to 9. This significantly reduces the amount of entropy in short strings generated by these functions.",
