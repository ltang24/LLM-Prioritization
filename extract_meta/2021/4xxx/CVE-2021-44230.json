  "Description": "PortSwigger Burp Suite Enterprise Edition before 2021.11 on Windows has weak file permissions for the embedded H2 database, which might lead to privilege escalation. This issue can be exploited by an adversary who has already compromised a valid Windows account on the server via separate means. In this scenario, the compromised account may have inherited read access to sensitive configuration, database, and log files.",
