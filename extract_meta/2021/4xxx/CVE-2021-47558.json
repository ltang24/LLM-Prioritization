  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: stmmac: Disable Tx queues when reconfiguring the interface\n\nThe Tx queues were not disabled in situations where the driver needed to\nstop the interface to apply a new configuration. This could result in a\nkernel panic when doing any of the 3 following actions:\n* reconfiguring the number of queues (ethtool -L)\n* reconfiguring the size of the ring buffers (ethtool -G)\n* installing/removing an XDP program (ip l set dev ethX xdp)\n\nPrevent the panic by making sure netif_tx_disable is called when stopping\nan interface.\n\nWithout this patch, the following kernel panic can be observed when doing\nany of the actions above:\n\nUnable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff80001238d040\n[....]\n Call trace:\n  dwmac4_set_addr+0x8/0x10\n  dev_hard_start_xmit+0xe4/0x1ac\n  sch_direct_xmit+0xe8/0x39c\n  __dev_queue_xmit+0x3ec/0xaf0\n  dev_queue_xmit+0x14/0x20\n[...]\n[ end trace 0000000000000002 ]---",
