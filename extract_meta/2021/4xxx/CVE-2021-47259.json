  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFS: Fix use-after-free in nfs4_init_client()\n\nKASAN reports a use-after-free when attempting to mount two different\nexports through two different NICs that belong to the same server.\n\nOlga was able to hit this with kernels starting somewhere between 5.7\nand 5.10, but I traced the patch that introduced the clear_bit() call to\n4.13. So something must have changed in the refcounting of the clp\npointer to make this call to nfs_put_client() the very last one.",
