  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/a3xx: fix error handling in a3xx_gpu_init()\n\nThese error paths returned 1 on failure, instead of a negative error\ncode.  This would lead to an Oops in the caller.  A second problem is\nthat the check for \"if (ret != -ENODATA)\" did not work because \"ret\" was\nset to 1.",
