  "Description": "Rasa is an open source machine learning framework to automate text-and voice-based conversations. In affected versions a vulnerability exists in the functionality that loads a trained model `tar.gz` file which allows a malicious actor to craft a `model.tar.gz` file which can overwrite or replace bot files in the bot directory. The vulnerability is fixed in Rasa 2.8.10. For users unable to update ensure that users do not upload untrusted model files, and restrict CLI or API endpoint access where a malicious actor could target a deployed Rasa instance.",
