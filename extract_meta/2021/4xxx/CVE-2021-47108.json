  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/mediatek: hdmi: Perform NULL pointer check for mtk_hdmi_conf\n\nIn commit 41ca9caaae0b\n(\"drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add check for CEA modes only\") a check\nfor CEA modes was added to function mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid()\nin order to address possible issues on MT8167;\nmoreover, with commit c91026a938c2\n(\"drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add optional limit on maximal HDMI mode clock\")\nanother similar check was introduced.\n\nUnfortunately though, at the time of writing, MT8173 does not provide\nany mtk_hdmi_conf structure and this is crashing the kernel with NULL\npointer upon entering mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid(), which happens as\nsoon as a HDMI cable gets plugged in.\n\nTo fix this regression, add a NULL pointer check for hdmi->conf in the\nsaid function, restoring HDMI functionality and avoiding NULL pointer\nkernel panics.",
