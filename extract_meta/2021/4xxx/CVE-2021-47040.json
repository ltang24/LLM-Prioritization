  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: fix overflows checks in provide buffers\n\nColin reported before possible overflow and sign extension problems in\nio_provide_buffers_prep(). As Linus pointed out previous attempt did nothing\nuseful, see d81269fecb8ce (\"io_uring: fix provide_buffers sign extension\").\n\nDo that with help of check_<op>_overflow helpers. And fix struct\nio_provide_buf::len type, as it doesn't make much sense to keep it\nsigned.",
