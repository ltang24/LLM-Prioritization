  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: idxd: Fix potential null dereference on pointer status\n\nThere are calls to idxd_cmd_exec that pass a null status pointer however\na recent commit has added an assignment to *status that can end up\nwith a null pointer dereference.  The function expects a null status\npointer sometimes as there is a later assignment to *status where\nstatus is first null checked.  Fix the issue by null checking status\nbefore making the assignment.\n\nAddresses-Coverity: (\"Explicit null dereferenced\")",
