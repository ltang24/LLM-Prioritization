  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nneighbour: allow NUD_NOARP entries to be forced GCed\n\nIFF_POINTOPOINT interfaces use NUD_NOARP entries for IPv6. It's possible to\nfill up the neighbour table with enough entries that it will overflow for\nvalid connections after that.\n\nThis behaviour is more prevalent after commit 58956317c8de (\"neighbor:\nImprove garbage collection\") is applied, as it prevents removal from\nentries that are not NUD_FAILED, unless they are more than 5s old.",
