  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/mount_setattr: always cleanup mount_kattr\n\nMake sure that finish_mount_kattr() is called after mount_kattr was\nsuccesfully built in both the success and failure case to prevent\nleaking any references we took when we built it.  We returned early if\npath lookup failed thereby risking to leak an additional reference we\ntook when building mount_kattr when an idmapped mount was requested.",
