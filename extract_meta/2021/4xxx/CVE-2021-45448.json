  "Description": "Pentaho Business Analytics\n Server versions before 9.2.0.2 and 8.3.0.25 using the Pentaho \nAnalyzer plugin exposes a service endpoint for templates which allows a \nuser-supplied path to access resources that are out of bounds.\u00a0\n\nThe software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or \ndirectory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not \nproperly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to \nresolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory. \u00a0By using special elements such as \n\"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted \nlocation to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the \nsystem.\n\n\n\n",
