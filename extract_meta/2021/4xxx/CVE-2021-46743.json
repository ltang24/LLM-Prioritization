  "Description": "In Firebase PHP-JWT before 6.0.0, an algorithm-confusion issue (e.g., RS256 / HS256) exists via the kid (aka Key ID) header, when multiple types of keys are loaded in a key ring. This allows an attacker to forge tokens that validate under the incorrect key. NOTE: this provides a straightforward way to use the PHP-JWT library unsafely, but might not be considered a vulnerability in the library itself.",
