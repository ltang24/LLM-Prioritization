  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nigb: Fix use-after-free error during reset\n\nCleans the next descriptor to watch (next_to_watch) when cleaning the\nTX ring.\n\nFailure to do so can cause invalid memory accesses. If igb_poll() runs\nwhile the controller is reset this can lead to the driver try to free\na skb that was already freed.\n\n(The crash is harder to reproduce with the igb driver, but the same\npotential problem exists as the code is identical to igc)",
