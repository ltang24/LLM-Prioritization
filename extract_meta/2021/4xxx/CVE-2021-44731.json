  "CVE Code": "CVE-2021-44731",
  "Published": "2022-02-17T00:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T04:32:12.887Z",
  "Description": "A race condition existed in the snapd 2.54.2 snap-confine binary when preparing a private mount namespace for a snap. This could allow a local attacker to gain root privileges by bind-mounting their own contents inside the snap's private mount namespace and causing snap-confine to execute arbitrary code and hence gain privilege escalation. Fixed in snapd versions 2.54.3+18.04, 2.54.3+20.04 and 2.54.3+21.10.1",
