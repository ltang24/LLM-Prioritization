  "Published": "2021-10-18T13:44:25",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T03:22:25.655Z",
  "Description": "The in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow upon receiving many requests with different certificates to fill the cache and later trigger the replacement of cache entries. The code attempts to select a less-often-used cache entry by means of a random number generator, but this is not done correctly. Remote code execution might be a slight possibility.",
