  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPI: fix NULL pointer dereference\n\nCommit 71f642833284 (\"ACPI: utils: Fix reference counting in\nfor_each_acpi_dev_match()\") started doing \"acpi_dev_put()\" on a pointer\nthat was possibly NULL.  That fails miserably, because that helper\ninline function is not set up to handle that case.\n\nJust make acpi_dev_put() silently accept a NULL pointer, rather than\ncalling down to put_device() with an invalid offset off that NULL\npointer.",
