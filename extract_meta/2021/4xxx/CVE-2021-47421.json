  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: handle the case of pci_channel_io_frozen only in amdgpu_pci_resume\n\nIn current code, when a PCI error state pci_channel_io_normal is detectd,\nit will report PCI_ERS_RESULT_CAN_RECOVER status to PCI driver, and PCI\ndriver will continue the execution of PCI resume callback report_resume by\npci_walk_bridge, and the callback will go into amdgpu_pci_resume\nfinally, where write lock is releasd unconditionally without acquiring\nsuch lock first. In this case, a deadlock will happen when other threads\nstart to acquire the read lock.\n\nTo fix this, add a member in amdgpu_device strucutre to cache\npci_channel_state, and only continue the execution in amdgpu_pci_resume\nwhen it's pci_channel_io_frozen.",
