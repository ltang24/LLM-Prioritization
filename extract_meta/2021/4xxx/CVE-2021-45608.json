  "Description": "Certain D-Link, Edimax, NETGEAR, TP-Link, Tenda, and Western Digital devices are affected by an integer overflow by an unauthenticated attacker. Remote code execution from the WAN interface (TCP port 20005) cannot be ruled out; however, exploitability was judged to be of \"rather significant complexity\" but not \"impossible.\" The overflow is in SoftwareBus_dispatchNormalEPMsgOut in the KCodes NetUSB kernel module. Affected NETGEAR devices are D7800 before 1.0.1.68, R6400v2 before 1.0.4.122, and R6700v3 before 1.0.4.122.",
