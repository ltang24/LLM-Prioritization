  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: core: Put LLD module refcnt after SCSI device is released\n\nSCSI host release is triggered when SCSI device is freed. We have to make\nsure that the low-level device driver module won't be unloaded before SCSI\nhost instance is released because shost->hostt is required in the release\nhandler.\n\nMake sure to put LLD module refcnt after SCSI device is released.\n\nFixes a kernel panic of 'BUG: unable to handle page fault for address'\nreported by Changhui and Yi.",
