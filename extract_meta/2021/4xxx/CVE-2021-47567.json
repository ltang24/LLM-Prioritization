  "Description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/32: Fix hardlockup on vmap stack overflow\n\nSince the commit c118c7303ad5 (\"powerpc/32: Fix vmap stack - Do not\nactivate MMU before reading task struct\") a vmap stack overflow\nresults in a hard lockup. This is because emergency_ctx is still\naddressed with its virtual address allthough data MMU is not active\nanymore at that time.\n\nFix it by using a physical address instead.",
