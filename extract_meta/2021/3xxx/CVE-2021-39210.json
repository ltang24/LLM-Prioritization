  "Description": "GLPI is a free Asset and IT management software package. In versions prior to 9.5.6, the cookie used to store the autologin cookie (when a user uses the \"remember me\" feature) is accessible by scripts. A malicious plugin that could steal this cookie would be able to use it to autologin. This issue is fixed in version 9.5.6. As a workaround, one may avoid using the \"remember me\" feature.",
