  "Description": "Apache Hive before 3.1.3 \"CREATE\" and \"DROP\" function operations does not check for necessary authorization of involved entities in the query.

This allowed unauthorized or underprivileged users to drop and recreate UDFs pointing them to new jars that could be potentially malicious.",
