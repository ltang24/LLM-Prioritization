  "Description": "Matrix-React-SDK is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. Before version 3.21.0, when uploading a file, the local file preview can lead to execution of scripts embedded in the uploaded file. This can only occur after several user interactions to open the preview in a separate tab. This only impacts the local user while in the process of uploading. It cannot be exploited remotely or by other users. This vulnerability is patched in version 3.21.0.",
