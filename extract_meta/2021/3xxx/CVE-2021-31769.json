  "Updated": "2024-08-03T23:03:33.870Z",
  "Description": "MyQ Server in MyQ X Smart before 8.2 allows remote code execution by unprivileged users because administrative session data can be read in the %PROGRAMFILES%\\MyQ\\PHP\\Sessions directory. The \"Select server file\" feature is only intended for administrators but actually does not require authorization. An attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands (such as commands to create new .php files) via the Task Scheduler component.",
