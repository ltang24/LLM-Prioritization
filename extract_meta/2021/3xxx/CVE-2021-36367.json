  "CVE Code": "CVE-2021-36367",
  "Published": "2021-07-09T00:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T00:54:51.472Z",
  "Description": "PuTTY through 0.75 proceeds with establishing an SSH session even if it has never sent a substantive authentication response. This makes it easier for an attacker-controlled SSH server to present a later spoofed authentication prompt (that the attacker can use to capture credential data, and use that data for purposes that are undesired by the client user).",
