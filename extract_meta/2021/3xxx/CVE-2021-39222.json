  "Description": "Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. The Nextcloud Talk application was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, a user would need to right-click on a malicious file and open the file in a new tab. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk application is upgraded to patched versions 10.0.7, 10.1.4, 11.1.2, 11.2.0 or 12.0.0. As a workaround, use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy.",
