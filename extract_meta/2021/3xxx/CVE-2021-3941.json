  "CVE Code": "CVE-2021-3941",
  "Published": "2022-03-25T00:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-03T17:09:09.632Z",
  "Description": "In ImfChromaticities.cpp routine RGBtoXYZ(), there are some division operations such as `float Z = (1 - chroma.white.x - chroma.white.y) * Y / chroma.white.y;` and `chroma.green.y * (X + Z))) / d;` but the divisor is not checked for a 0 value. A specially crafted file could trigger a divide-by-zero condition which could affect the availability of programs linked with OpenEXR.",
