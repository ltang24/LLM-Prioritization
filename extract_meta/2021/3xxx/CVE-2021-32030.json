  "Description": "The administrator application on ASUS GT-AC2900 devices before 3.0.0.4.386.42643 and Lyra Mini before 3.0.0.4_384_46630 allows authentication bypass when processing remote input from an unauthenticated user, leading to unauthorized access to the administrator interface. This relates to handle_request in router/httpd/httpd.c and auth_check in web_hook.o. An attacker-supplied value of '\\0' matches the device's default value of '\\0' in some situations. Note: All versions of Lyra Mini and earlier which are unsupported (End-of-Life, EOL) are also affected by this vulnerability, Consumers can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling the remote access features from WAN.",
