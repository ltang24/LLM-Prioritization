  "Published": "2021-04-17T04:20:16.011472Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-17T03:54:52.527Z",
  "Description": "Shiftfs, an out-of-tree stacking file system included in Ubuntu Linux kernels, did not properly handle faults occurring during copy_from_user() correctly. These could lead to either a double-free situation or memory not being freed at all. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion) or gain privileges via executing arbitrary code. AKA ZDI-CAN-13562.",
