  "Description": "OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, there is a critical vulnerability involving the build endpoint parameters. InputSpec is used to define parameters of a Build spec. It does so by using dynamically generated Groovy classes. A user able to control job parameters can run arbitrary code on OneDev's server by injecting arbitrary Groovy code. The ultimate result is in the injection of a static constructor that will run arbitrary code. For a full example refer to the referenced GHSA. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by escaping special characters such as quote from user input.",
