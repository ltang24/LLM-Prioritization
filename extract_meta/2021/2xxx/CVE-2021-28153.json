  "CVE Code": "CVE-2021-28153",
  "Published": "2021-03-11T21:04:15",
  "Updated": "2024-08-03T21:40:12.088Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.8. When g_file_replace() is used with G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION to replace a path that is a dangling symlink, it incorrectly also creates the target of the symlink as an empty file, which could conceivably have security relevance if the symlink is attacker-controlled. (If the path is a symlink to a file that already exists, then the contents of that file correctly remain unchanged.)",
