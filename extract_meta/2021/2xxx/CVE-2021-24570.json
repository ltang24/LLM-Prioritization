  "Updated": "2024-08-03T19:35:20.193Z",
  "Description": "The Accept Donations with PayPal WordPress plugin before 1.3.1 offers a function to create donation buttons, which internally are posts. The process to create a new button is lacking a CSRF check. An attacker could use this to make an authenticated admin create a new button. Furthermore, one of the Button field is not escaped before being output in an attribute when editing a Button, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue as well.",
