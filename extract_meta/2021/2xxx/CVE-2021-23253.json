  "CVE Code": "CVE-2021-23253",
  "Published": "2021-01-11T15:43:01",
  "Updated": "2024-08-03T19:05:55.603Z",
  "Description": "Opera Mini for Android below 53.1 displays URL left-aligned in the address field. This allows a malicious attacker to craft a URL with a long domain name, e.g. www.safe.opera.com.attacker.com. With the URL being left-aligned, the user will only see the front part (e.g. www.safe.opera.com\u2026) The exact amount depends on the phone screen size but the attacker can craft a number of different domains and target different phones. Starting with version 53.1 Opera Mini displays long URLs with the top-level domain label aligned to the right of the address field which mitigates the issue.",
