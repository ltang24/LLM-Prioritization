  "Description": "BIRD through 2.0.7 does not provide functionality for password authentication of BGP peers. Because of this, products that use BIRD (which may, for example, include Tigera products in some configurations, as well as products of other vendors) may have been susceptible to route redirection for Denial of Service and/or Information Disclosure. NOTE: a researcher has asserted that the behavior is within Tigera\u2019s area of responsibility; however, Tigera disagrees",
