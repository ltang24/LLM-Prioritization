  "CVE Code": "CVE-2021-22037",
  "Published": "2021-10-29T11:09:07",
  "Updated": "2024-08-03T18:30:24.009Z",
  "Description": "Under certain circumstances, when manipulating the Windows registry, InstallBuilder uses the reg.exe system command. The full path to the command is not enforced, which results in a search in the search path until a binary can be identified. This makes the installer/uninstaller vulnerable to Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking, potentially allowing an attacker to plant a malicious reg.exe command so it takes precedence over the system command. The vulnerability only affects Windows installers.",

    "Uncontrolled Search Path Element"
