  "Updated": "2024-08-03T18:09:15.042Z",
  "Description": "In Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability involving the --userns-remap option in which access to remapped root allows privilege escalation to real root. When using \"--userns-remap\", if the root user in the remapped namespace has access to the host filesystem they can modify files under \"/var/lib/docker/<remapping>\" that cause writing files with extended privileges. Versions 20.10.3 and 19.03.15 contain patches that prevent privilege escalation from remapped user.",
