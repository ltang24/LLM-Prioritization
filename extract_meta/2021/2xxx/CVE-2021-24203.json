  "Description": "In the Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.1.4, the divider widget (includes/widgets/divider.php) accepts an \u2018html_tag\u2019 parameter. Although the element control lists a fixed set of possible html tags, it is possible for a user with Contributor or above permissions to send a modified \u2018save_builder\u2019 request with this parameter set to \u2018script\u2019 and combined with a \u2018text\u2019 parameter containing JavaScript, which will then be executed when the saved page is viewed or previewed.",
