  "CVE Code": "CVE-2021-25215",
  "Published": "2021-04-29T00:55:16.726513Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-16T22:02:24.791Z",
  "Description": "In BIND 9.0.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.11 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, when a vulnerable version of named receives a query for a record triggering the flaw described above, the named process will terminate due to a failed assertion check. The vulnerability affects all currently maintained BIND 9 branches (9.11, 9.11-S, 9.16, 9.16-S, 9.17) as well as all other versions of BIND 9.",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "DNAME records, described in RFC 6672, provide a way to redirect a subtree of the domain name tree in the DNS. A flaw in the way named processes these records may trigger an attempt to add the same RRset to the ANSWER section more than once. This causes an assertion check in BIND to fail.  DNAME records are processed by both authoritative and recursive servers. For authoritative servers, the DNAME record triggering the flaw can be retrieved from a zone database. For servers performing recursion, such a record is processed in the course of a query sent to an authoritative server.  Affects BIND 9.0.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.11 of the BIND 9.17 development branch."
