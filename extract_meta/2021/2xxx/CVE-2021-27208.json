  "Published": "2021-03-15T12:27:26",
  "Updated": "2024-08-03T20:40:47.492Z",
  "Description": "When booting a Zync-7000 SOC device from nand flash memory, the nand driver in the ROM does not validate the inputs when reading in any parameters in the nand\u2019s parameter page. IF a field read in from the parameter page is too large, this causes a buffer overflow that could lead to arbitrary code execution. Physical access and modification of the board assembly on which the Zynq-7000 SoC device mounted is needed to replace the original NAND flash memory with a NAND flash emulation device for this attack to be successful.",
