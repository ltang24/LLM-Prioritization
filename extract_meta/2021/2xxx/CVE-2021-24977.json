  "Description": "The Use Any Font | Custom Font Uploader WordPress plugin before 6.2.1 does not have any authorisation checks when assigning a font, allowing unauthenticated users to sent arbitrary CSS which will then be processed by the frontend for all users. Due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping in the backend, it could also lead to Stored XSS issues",
