  "Published": "2021-02-23T21:32:26",
  "Updated": "2024-08-03T17:30:07.425Z",
  "Description": "A privilege escalation flaw was found in openshift4/ose-docker-builder. The build container runs with high privileges using a chrooted environment instead of runc. If an attacker can gain access to this build container, they can potentially utilize the raw devices of the underlying node, such as the network and storage devices, to at least escalate their privileges to that of the cluster admin. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",
