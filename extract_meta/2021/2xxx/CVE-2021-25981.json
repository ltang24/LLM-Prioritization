  "Description": "In Talkyard, regular versions v0.2021.20 through v0.2021.33 and dev versions v0.2021.20 through v0.2021.34, are vulnerable to Insufficient Session Expiration. This may allow an attacker to reuse the admin\u2019s still-valid session token even when logged-out, to gain admin privileges, given the attacker is able to obtain that token (via other, hypothetical attacks)",
