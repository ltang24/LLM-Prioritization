  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying filesystem of an affected system.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient access control for sensitive information that is written to an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing sensitive information that they are not authorized to access on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to devices and other network management systems that they should not have access to.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
