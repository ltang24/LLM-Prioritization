  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco&nbsp;SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain read and write access to information that is stored on an affected system.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when the affected software parses certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to import a crafted XML file with malicious entries. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and write files within the affected application.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
