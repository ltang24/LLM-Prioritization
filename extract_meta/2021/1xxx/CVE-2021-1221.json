The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering a URL into a field in the user interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to generate a Webex Meetings invitation email that contains a link to a destination of their choosing. Because this email is sent from a trusted source, the recipient may be more likely to click the link.",
