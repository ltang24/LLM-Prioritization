  "Description": "Wi-Fi in Apple iOS before 10.3.1 does not prevent CVE-2017-6956 stack buffer overflow exploitation via a crafted access point.  NOTE: because an operating system could potentially isolate itself from CVE-2017-6956 exploitation without patching Broadcom firmware functions, there is a separate CVE ID for the operating-system behavior.",
