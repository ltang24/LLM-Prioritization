  "Published": "2017-02-24T15:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T15:11:47.757Z",
  "Description": "The do_shmat function in ipc/shm.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.12 does not restrict the address calculated by a certain rounding operation, which allows local users to map page zero, and consequently bypass a protection mechanism that exists for the mmap system call, by making crafted shmget and shmat system calls in a privileged context.",
