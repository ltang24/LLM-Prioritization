  "CVE Code": "CVE-2017-3143",
  "Published": "2019-01-16T20:00:00Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-16T16:14:21.796Z",
  "Description": "An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name for the zone and service being targeted may be able to manipulate BIND into accepting an unauthorized dynamic update. Affects BIND 9.4.0->9.8.8, 9.9.0->9.9.10-P1, 9.10.0->9.10.5-P1, 9.11.0->9.11.1-P1, 9.9.3-S1->9.9.10-S2, 9.10.5-S1->9.10.5-S2.",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "A server that relies solely on TSIG keys with no other address-based ACL protection could be vulnerable to malicious zone content manipulation using this technique.\n\nNote that the local update policy (configured with \"update-policy local;\" in named.conf) implicitly defines a key with a known key name (local-ddns) and default algorithm and no IP-based access controls on the zone updates.  In conjunction with this failure in TSIG verification, \"update-policy local\" is potentially very dangerous."
