  "Updated": "2024-09-17T00:10:46.349Z",
  "Description": "BIND was improperly sequencing cleanup operations on upstream recursion fetch contexts, leading in some cases to a use-after-free error that can trigger an assertion failure and crash in named. Affects BIND 9.0.0 to 9.8.x, 9.9.0 to 9.9.11, 9.10.0 to 9.10.6, 9.11.0 to 9.11.2, 9.9.3-S1 to 9.9.11-S1, 9.10.5-S1 to 9.10.6-S1, 9.12.0a1 to 9.12.0rc1.",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "While this bug has existed in BIND since 9.0.0, there are no known code paths leading to it in ISC releases prior to those containing the fix for CVE-2017-3137.  Thus while all instances of BIND ought to be patched, only ISC versions [9.9.9-P8 to 9.9.11, 9.10.4-P8 to 9.10.6, 9.11.0-P5 to 9.11.2, 9.9.9-S10 to 9.9.11-S1, 9.10.5-S1 to 9.10.6-S1, and 9.12.0a1 to 9.12.0rc1] acting as DNSSEC validating resolvers are currently known to crash due to this bug.  The known crash is an assertion failure in netaddr.c."
