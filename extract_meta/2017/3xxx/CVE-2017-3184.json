  "Published": "2017-12-15T14:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T14:16:28.231Z",
  "Description": "ACTi cameras including the D, B, I, and E series using firmware version A1D-500-V6.11.31-AC fail to properly restrict access to the factory reset page. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing the http://x.x.x.x/setup/setup_maintain_firmware-default.html page. This will allow an attacker to perform a factory reset on the device, leading to a denial of service condition or the ability to make use of default credentials (CVE-2017-3186).",
