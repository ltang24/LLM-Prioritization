  "Description": "An issue was discovered in the OpenWebif plugin through 1.2.4 for E2 open devices. The saveConfig function of \"plugin/controllers/models/config.py\" performs an eval() call on the contents of the \"key\" HTTP GET parameter. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary Python code or OS commands via api/saveconfig.",
