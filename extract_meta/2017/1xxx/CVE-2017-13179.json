  "CVE Code": "CVE-2017-13179",
  "Published": "2018-01-12T23:00:00Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-16T22:30:04.808Z",
  "Description": "In the ihevcd_allocate_static_bufs and ihevcd_create functions of SoftHEVC, there is a possible out-of-bounds write due to a use after free. Both ps_codec_obj and ps_create_op->s_ivd_create_op_t.pv_handle point to the same memory and ps_codec_obj could be freed without clearing ps_create_op->s_ivd_create_op_t.pv_handle. This could lead to remote code execution as a privileged process with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android. Versions: 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1. Android ID: A-66969193.",
