  "Updated": "2024-09-16T17:08:44.858Z",
  "Description": "In Jenkins Script Security Plugin version 1.36 and earlier, users with the ability to configure sandboxed Groovy scripts are able to use a type coercion feature in Groovy to create new `File` objects from strings. This allowed reading arbitrary files on the Jenkins master file system. Such a type coercion is now subject to sandbox protection and considered to be a call to the `new File(String)` constructor for the purpose of in-process script approval.",
