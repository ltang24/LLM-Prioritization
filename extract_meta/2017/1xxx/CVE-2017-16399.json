  "CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16399",
  "Published": "2017-12-09T06:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T20:27:03.399Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. This issue is due to an untrusted pointer dereference in the XPS parsing module. In this scenario, the input is crafted in a way that the computation results in pointers to memory locations that do not belong to the relevant process address space. The dereferencing operation is a read operation, and an attack can result in sensitive data exposure.",
