  "Updated": "2024-08-05T20:20:05.535Z",
  "Description": "An attacker could send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability in Insteon Hub running firmware version 1012. At 0x9d01c224 the value for the s_vol_play key is copied using strcpy to the buffer at 0xa0000418. This buffer is maximum 8 bytes large (this is the maximum size it could be, it is possible other global variables are stored between this variable and the next one that we could identify), sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.",
