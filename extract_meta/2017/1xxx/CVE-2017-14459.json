        "Moxa AWK-3131A Industrial IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n wireless AP/bridge/client versions 1.4 - 1.9. In addition, versions prior to 1.4 appear similarly vulnerable to injection, but not as easily exploitable (described below). Other models in the AWK product line may likewise be vulnerable but have not been tested."
