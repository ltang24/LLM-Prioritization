  "Description": "An attacker could send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability in Insteon Hub running firmware version 1012. At 0x9d01c368 the value for the s_mac key is copied using strcpy to the buffer at 0xa000170c. This buffer is 25 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow. The destination can also be shifted by using an sn_speaker parameter between \"0\" and \"3\".",
