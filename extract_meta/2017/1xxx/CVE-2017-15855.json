  "Published": "2018-05-17T22:00:00Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-17T03:13:51.389Z",
  "Description": "In Qualcomm Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, and QRD Android with all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel before security patch level 2018-04-05, the camera application triggers \"user-memory-access\" issue as the Camera CPP module Linux driver directly accesses the application provided buffer, which resides in user space. An unchecked userspace value (ioctl_ptr->len) is used to copy contents to a kernel buffer which can lead to kernel buffer overflow.",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input in Camera"
