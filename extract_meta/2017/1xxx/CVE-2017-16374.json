  "Published": "2017-12-09T06:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T20:27:02.531Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. The vulnerability is caused by a buffer over-read in the JPEG 2000 module. An invalid JPEG 2000 input code stream leads to a computation where the pointer arithmetic results in a location outside valid memory locations belonging to the buffer. An attack can be used to obtain sensitive information, such as object heap addresses, etc.",
