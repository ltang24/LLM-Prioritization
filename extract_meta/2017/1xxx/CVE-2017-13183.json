  "Updated": "2024-09-17T01:26:48.492Z",
  "Description": "In the OMXNodeInstance::useBuffer and IOMX::freeBuffer functions, there is a possible use after free due to a race condition if the user frees the buffer while it's being used in another thread. This could lead to a local elevation of privilege enabling code execution as a privileged process with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation. Product: Android. Versions: 8.1. Android ID: A-38118127.",
