  "Updated": "2024-08-05T20:59:17.205Z",
  "Description": "In Octopus Deploy before 4.1.3, the machine update process doesn't check that the user has access to all environments. This allows an access-control bypass because the set of environments to which a machine is scoped may include environments in which the user lacks access.",
