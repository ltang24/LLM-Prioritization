  "Updated": "2024-08-05T19:50:16.095Z",
  "Description": "When libvirtd is configured by OSP director (tripleo-heat-templates) to use the TLS transport it defaults to the same certificate authority as all non-libvirtd services. As no additional authentication is configured this allows these services to connect to libvirtd (which is equivalent to root access). If a vulnerability exists in another service it could, combined with this flaw, be exploited to escalate privileges to gain control over compute nodes.",
