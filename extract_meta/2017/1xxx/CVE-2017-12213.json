  "Description": "A vulnerability in the dynamic access control list (ACL) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software running on Cisco Catalyst 4000 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause dynamic ACL assignment to fail and the port to fail open. This could allow the attacker to pass traffic to the default VLAN of the affected port. The vulnerability is due to an uncaught error condition that may occur during the reassignment of the auth-default-ACL dynamic ACL to a switch port after 802.1x authentication fails. A successful exploit of this issue could allow a physically adjacent attacker to bypass 802.1x authentication and cause the affected port to fail open, allowing the attacker to pass traffic to the default VLAN of the affected switch port.
