  "Updated": "2024-09-16T19:19:33.991Z",
  "Description": "Http-signature is a \"Reference implementation of Joyent's HTTP Signature Scheme\". In versions <=0.9.11, http-signature signs only the header values, but not the header names. This makes http-signature vulnerable to header forgery. Thus, if an attacker can intercept a request, he can swap header names and change the meaning of the request without changing the signature.",
