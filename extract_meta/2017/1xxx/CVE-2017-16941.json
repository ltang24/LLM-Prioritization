  "Description": "October CMS through 1.0.428 does not prevent use of .htaccess in themes, which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP code by downloading a theme ZIP archive from /backend/cms/themes, and then uploading and importing a modified archive with two new files: a .php file and a .htaccess file. NOTE: the vendor says \"I don't think [an attacker able to login to the system under an account that has access to manage/upload themes] is a threat model that we need to be considering.",
