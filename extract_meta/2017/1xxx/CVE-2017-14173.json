  "Updated": "2024-08-05T19:20:41.015Z",
  "Description": "In the function ReadTXTImage() in coders/txt.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6-10, an integer overflow might occur for the addition operation \"GetQuantumRange(depth)+1\" when \"depth\" is large, producing a smaller value than expected. As a result, an infinite loop would occur for a crafted TXT file that claims a very large \"max_value\" value.",
