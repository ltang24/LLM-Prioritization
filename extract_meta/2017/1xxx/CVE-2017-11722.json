  "CVE Code": "CVE-2017-11722",
  "Published": "2017-07-28T13:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T18:19:39.011Z",
  "Description": "The WriteOnePNGImage function in coders/png.c in GraphicsMagick 1.3.26 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted file, because the program's actual control flow was inconsistent with its indentation. This resulted in a logging statement executing outside of a loop, and consequently using an invalid array index corresponding to the loop's exit condition.",
