  "CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16997",
  "Published": "2017-12-18T01:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T20:43:59.423Z",
  "Description": "elf/dl-load.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.19 through 2.26 mishandles RPATH and RUNPATH containing $ORIGIN for a privileged (setuid or AT_SECURE) program, which allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse library in the current working directory, related to the fillin_rpath and decompose_rpath functions. This is associated with misinterpretion of an empty RPATH/RUNPATH token as the \"./\" directory. NOTE: this configuration of RPATH/RUNPATH for a privileged program is apparently very uncommon; most likely, no such program is shipped with any common Linux distribution.",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "improper RPATH/RUNPATH validation"
