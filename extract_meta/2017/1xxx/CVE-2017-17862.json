  "CVE Code": "CVE-2017-17862",
  "Published": "2017-12-23T17:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T21:06:48.982Z",
  "Description": "kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.8 ignores unreachable code, even though it would still be processed by JIT compilers. This behavior, also considered an improper branch-pruning logic issue, could possibly be used by local users for denial of service.",
