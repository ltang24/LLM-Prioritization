  "Updated": "2024-08-05T16:12:28.434Z",
  "Description": "The content security policy (CSP) \"sandbox\" directive did not create a unique origin for the document, causing it to behave as if the \"allow-same-origin\" keyword were always specified. This could allow a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack to be launched from unsafe content. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.",
