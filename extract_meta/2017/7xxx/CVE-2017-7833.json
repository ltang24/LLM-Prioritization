  "Description": "Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin characters in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some font sets on the addressbar. The non-Latin character will not be visible to most viewers. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57.",
