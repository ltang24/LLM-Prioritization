  "CVE Code": "CVE-2017-7805",
  "Published": "2018-06-11T21:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T16:12:28.369Z",
  "Description": "During TLS 1.2 exchanges, handshake hashes are generated which point to a message buffer. This saved data is used for later messages but in some cases, the handshake transcript can exceed the space available in the current buffer, causing the allocation of a new buffer. This leaves a pointer pointing to the old, freed buffer, resulting in a use-after-free when handshake hashes are then calculated afterwards. This can result in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.",
