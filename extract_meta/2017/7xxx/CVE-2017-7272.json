  "Published": "2017-03-27T17:00:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T15:56:36.360Z",
  "Description": "PHP through 7.1.11 enables potential SSRF in applications that accept an fsockopen or pfsockopen hostname argument with an expectation that the port number is constrained. Because a :port syntax is recognized, fsockopen will use the port number that is specified in the hostname argument, instead of the port number in the second argument of the function.",
