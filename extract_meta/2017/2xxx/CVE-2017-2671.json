  "Published": "2017-04-05T06:23:00",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T14:02:07.183Z",
  "Description": "The ping_unhash function in net/ipv4/ping.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.8 is too late in obtaining a certain lock and consequently cannot ensure that disconnect function calls are safe, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) by leveraging access to the protocol value of IPPROTO_ICMP in a socket system call.",
