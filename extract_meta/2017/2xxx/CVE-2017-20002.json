  "CVE Code": "CVE-2017-20002",
  "Published": "2021-03-17T06:00:09",
  "Updated": "2024-08-05T21:45:24.409Z",
  "Description": "The Debian shadow package before 1:4.5-1 for Shadow incorrectly lists pts/0 and pts/1 as physical terminals in /etc/securetty. This allows local users to login as password-less users even if they are connected by non-physical means such as SSH (hence bypassing PAM's nullok_secure configuration). This notably affects environments such as virtual machines automatically generated with a default blank root password, allowing all local users to escalate privileges.",
