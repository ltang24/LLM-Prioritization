  "Published": "2017-06-30T20:00:00Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-16T23:52:02.685Z",
  "Description": "Versions of MCollective prior to 2.10.4 deserialized YAML from agents without calling safe_load, allowing the potential for arbitrary code execution on the server. The fix for this is to call YAML.safe_load on input. This has been tested in all Puppet-supplied MCollective plugins, but there is a chance that third-party plugins could rely on this insecure behavior.",
