  "Description": "Pivotal Concourse, most versions prior to 6.0.0, allows redirects to untrusted websites in its login flow. A remote unauthenticated attacker could convince a user to click on a link using the OAuth redirect link with an untrusted website and gain access to that user's access token in Concourse. (This issue is similar to, but distinct from, CVE-2018-15798.)",
