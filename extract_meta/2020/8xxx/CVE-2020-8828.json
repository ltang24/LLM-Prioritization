  "CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8828",
  "Published": "2020-04-08T19:49:14",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T10:12:10.971Z",
  "Description": "As of v1.5.0, the default admin password is set to the argocd-server pod name. For insiders with access to the cluster or logs, this issue could be abused for privilege escalation, as Argo has privileged roles. A malicious insider is the most realistic threat, but pod names are not meant to be kept secret and could wind up just about anywhere.",
