  "CVE Code": "CVE-2020-8621",
  "Published": "2020-08-21T20:50:18.959156Z",
  "Updated": "2024-09-16T16:18:00.777Z",
  "Description": "In BIND 9.14.0 -> 9.16.5, 9.17.0 -> 9.17.3, If a server is configured with both QNAME minimization and 'forward first' then an attacker who can send queries to it may be able to trigger the condition that will cause the server to crash. Servers that 'forward only' are not affected.",
  "ProblemTypes": [
    "While query forwarding and QNAME minimization are mutually incompatible, BIND did sometimes allow QNAME minimization when continuing with recursion after 'forward first' did not result in an answer. In these cases the data used by QNAME minimization might be inconsistent, leading to an assertion failure, causing the server to exit.  Affects BIND 9.14.0 -> 9.16.5, 9.17.0 -> 9.17.3"
