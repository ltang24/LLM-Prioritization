  "Description": "The server in Circontrol Raption through 5.11.2 has a pre-authentication stack-based buffer overflow that can be exploited to gain run-time control of the device as root. The ocpp1.5 and pwrstudio binaries on the charging station do not use a number of common exploitation mitigations. In particular, there are no stack canaries and they do not use the Position Independent Executable (PIE) format.",
