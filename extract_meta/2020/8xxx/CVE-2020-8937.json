  "Updated": "2024-08-04T10:12:11.093Z",
  "Description": "An arbitrary memory overwrite vulnerability in Asylo versions up to 0.6.0 allows an attacker to make a host call to enc_untrusted_create_wait_queue that uses a pointer queue that relies on UntrustedLocalMemcpy, which fails to validate where the pointer is located. This allows an attacker to write memory values from within the enclave. We recommend upgrading past commit a37fb6a0e7daf30134dbbf357c9a518a1026aa02",
