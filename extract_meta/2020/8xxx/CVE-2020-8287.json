  "Published": "2021-01-06T00:00:00",
  "Updated": "2025-04-30T22:24:29.487Z",
  "Description": "Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 allow two copies of a header field in an HTTP request (for example, two Transfer-Encoding header fields). In this case, Node.js identifies the first header field and ignores the second. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling.",
