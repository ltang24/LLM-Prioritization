  "Published": "2020-12-09T00:23:31",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T16:03:23.165Z",
  "Description": "When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.",

    "DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses"
