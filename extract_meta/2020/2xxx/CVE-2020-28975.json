  "Description": "svm_predict_values in svm.cpp in Libsvm v324, as used in scikit-learn 0.23.2 and other products, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a crafted model SVM (introduced via pickle, json, or any other model permanence standard) with a large value in the _n_support array. NOTE: the scikit-learn vendor's position is that the behavior can only occur if the library's API is violated by an application that changes a private attribute.",
