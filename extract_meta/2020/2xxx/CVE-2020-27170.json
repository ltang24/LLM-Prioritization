  "CVE Code": "CVE-2020-27170",
  "Published": "2021-03-20T21:30:36",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T16:11:35.904Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-f232326f6966. This affects pointer types that do not define a ptr_limit.",
