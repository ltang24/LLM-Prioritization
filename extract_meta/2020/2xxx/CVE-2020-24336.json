  "Updated": "2024-08-04T15:12:08.454Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Contiki through 3.0 and Contiki-NG through 4.5. The code for parsing Type A domain name answers in ip64-dns64.c doesn't verify whether the address in the answer's length is sane. Therefore, when copying an address of an arbitrary length, a buffer overflow can occur. This bug can be exploited whenever NAT64 is enabled.",
