  "Updated": "2024-08-04T16:03:23.183Z",
  "Description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.1.0), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.1.0). Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing of RGB and SGI files. This could result in a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-11986, ZDI-CAN-11994)",
