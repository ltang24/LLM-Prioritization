  "Published": "2020-10-07T14:07:36",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T15:19:09.383Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in the GAEN (aka Google/Apple Exposure Notifications) protocol through 2020-10-05, as used in COVID-19 applications on Android and iOS. The encrypted metadata block with a TX value lacks a checksum, allowing bitflipping to amplify a contamination attack. This can cause metadata deanonymization and risk-score inflation. NOTE: the vendor's position is \"We do not believe that TX power authentication would be a useful defense against relay attacks.",
