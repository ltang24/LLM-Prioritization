  "Description": "An integer underflow has been found in the latest version of ZCFees. The variables 'currPeriodIdx' and 'lastPeriodExecIdx' are both unsigned integers, and the result of the minus operation may be a negative integer which leads to an underflow. The attackers can modify the current timestamp of the transaction somehow and block the execution of the process function.",
