  "Updated": "2024-08-04T15:49:07.203Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept plaintext A-MSDU frames as long as the first 8 bytes correspond to a valid RFC1042 (i.e., LLC/SNAP) header for EAPOL. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration.",
