  "Description": "SAP Commerce Cloud, versions - 1808, 1811, 1905, 2005, exposes several web applications that maintain sessions with a user. These sessions are established after the user has authenticated with username/passphrase credentials. The user can change their own passphrase, but this does not invalidate active sessions that the user may have with SAP Commerce Cloud web applications, which gives an attacker the opportunity to reuse old session credentials, resulting in Insufficient Session Expiration.",
