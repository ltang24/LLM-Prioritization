  "Published": "2020-03-24T20:39:31",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T08:47:41.076Z",
  "Description": "An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the message-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing mDNS messages in mdns_recv, the return value of the mdns_read_header function is not checked, leading to an uninitialized variable usage that eventually results in a null pointer dereference, leading to service crash. An attacker can send a series of mDNS messages to trigger this vulnerability.",
