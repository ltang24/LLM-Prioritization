  "Updated": "2024-08-04T08:47:41.017Z",
  "Description": "ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware before version 1.0.713 copies files for the report from a directory with low privileges. A sophisticated timed attacker can replace those files with malicious or linked content, such as exploiting CVE-2020-0896 on unpatched systems or using symbolic links. This allows an unprivileged user to enable escalation of privilege via local access.",
