  "Published": "2020-03-24T20:39:22",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T08:47:40.911Z",
  "Description": "An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the message-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing mDNS messages, the implementation does not properly keep track of the available data in the message, possibly leading to an out-of-bounds read that would result in a denial of service. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability.",
