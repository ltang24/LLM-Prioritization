  "Description": "Function abc_pcie_issue_dma_xfer_sync creates a transfer object, adds it to the session object then continues to work with it. A concurrent thread could retrieve created transfer object from the session object and delete it using abc_pcie_dma_user_xfer_clean. If this happens, abc_pcie_start_dma_xfer and abc_pcie_wait_dma_xfer in the original thread will trigger UAF when working with the transfer object.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-151453714",
