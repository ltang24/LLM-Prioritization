  "CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12691",
  "Published": "2020-05-06T23:43:01",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T12:04:22.558Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. Any authenticated user can create an EC2 credential for themselves for a project that they have a specified role on, and then perform an update to the credential user and project, allowing them to masquerade as another user. This potentially allows a malicious user to act as the admin on a project another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant that user global admin privileges.",
