  "Updated": "2024-08-04T13:08:21.734Z",
  "Description": "etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10 does not perform any password length validation, which allows for very short passwords, such as those with a length of one. This may allow an attacker to guess or brute-force users' passwords with little computational effort.",
