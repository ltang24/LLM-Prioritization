  "Description": "A logic bug flaw was found in Linux kernel before 5.8-rc1 in the implementation of SSBD. A bug in the logic handling allows an attacker with a local account to disable SSBD protection during a context switch when additional speculative execution mitigations are in place. This issue was introduced when the per task/process conditional STIPB switching was added on top of the existing SSBD switching. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.",
