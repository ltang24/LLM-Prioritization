  "CVE Code": "CVE-2020-15187",
  "Published": "2020-09-17T21:50:12",
  "Updated": "2025-05-29T22:59:03.267Z",
  "Description": "In Helm before versions 2.16.11 and 3.3.2, a Helm plugin can contain duplicates of the same entry, with the last one always used. If a plugin is compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to modify a plugin's install hooks, causing a local execution attack.\nTo perform this attack, an attacker must have write access to the git repository or plugin archive (.tgz) while being downloaded (which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection). This issue has been patched in Helm 2.16.11 and Helm 3.3.2.\nAs a possible workaround make sure to install plugins using a secure connection protocol like SSL.",
