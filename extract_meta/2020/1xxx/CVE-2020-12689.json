  "CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12689",
  "Published": "2020-05-06T23:43:20",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T12:04:22.561Z",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. Any user authenticated within a limited scope (trust/oauth/application credential) can create an EC2 credential with an escalated permission, such as obtaining admin while the user is on a limited viewer role. This potentially allows a malicious user to act as the admin on a project another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant that user global admin privileges.",
