  "Description": "An issue was discovered in PassMark BurnInTest through 9.1, OSForensics through 7.1, and PerformanceTest through 10. The kernel driver exposes IOCTL functionality that allows low-privilege users to read and write to arbitrary Model Specific Registers (MSRs). This could lead to arbitrary Ring-0 code execution and escalation of privileges. This affects DirectIo32.sys and DirectIo64.sys.",
