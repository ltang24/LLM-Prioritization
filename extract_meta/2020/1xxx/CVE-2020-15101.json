  "Updated": "2024-08-04T13:08:21.765Z",
  "Description": "In freewvs before 0.1.1, a directory structure of more than 1000 nested directories can interrupt a freewvs scan due to Python's recursion limit and os.walk(). This can be problematic in a case where an administrator scans the dirs of potentially untrusted users. This has been patched in 0.1.1.",
