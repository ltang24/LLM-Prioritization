  "Published": "2020-06-04T14:01:53",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T12:25:16.506Z",
  "Description": "The Elliptic package 6.5.2 for Node.js allows ECDSA signature malleability via variations in encoding, leading '\\0' bytes, or integer overflows. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact if an application relied on a single canonical signature.",
