  "Updated": "2024-08-04T11:56:51.888Z",
  "Description": "When performing add-on updates, certificate chains terminating in non-built-in-roots were rejected (even if they were legitimately added by an administrator.)

  "ProblemTypes": [
    "Add-On updates did not respect the same certificate trust rules as software updates"
