  "Updated": "2024-08-04T13:08:22.833Z",
  "Description": "In Shrine before version 3.3.0, when using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin, it's possible for the attacker to use a timing attack to guess the signature of the derivation URL. The problem has been fixed by comparing sent and calculated signature in constant time, using `Rack::Utils.secure_compare`. Users using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin are urged to upgrade to Shrine 3.3.0 or greater. A possible workaround is provided in the linked advisory.",
