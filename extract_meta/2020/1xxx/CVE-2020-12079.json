  "Updated": "2024-08-04T11:48:58.043Z",
  "Description": "Beaker before 0.8.9 allows a sandbox escape, enabling system access and code execution. This occurs because Electron context isolation is not used, and therefore an attacker can conduct a prototype-pollution attack against the Electron internal messaging API.",
