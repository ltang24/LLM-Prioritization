  "Updated": "2024-08-04T11:35:12.858Z",
  "Description": "The Rank Math plugin through 1.0.40.2 for WordPress allows unauthenticated remote attackers to create new URIs (that redirect to an external web site) via the unsecured rankmath/v1/updateRedirection REST API endpoint. In other words, this is not an \"Open Redirect\" issue; instead, it allows the attacker to create a new URI with an arbitrary name (e.g., the /exampleredirect URI).",
