  "Updated": "2024-08-04T12:11:19.196Z",
  "Description": "In OASIS Digital Signature Services (DSS) 1.0, an attacker can control the validation outcome (i.e., trigger either a valid or invalid outcome for a valid or invalid signature) via a crafted XML signature, when the InlineXML option is used. This defeats the expectation of non-repudiation.",
