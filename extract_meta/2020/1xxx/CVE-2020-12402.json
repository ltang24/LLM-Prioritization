  "CVE Code": "CVE-2020-12402",
  "Published": "2020-07-09T14:53:22",
  "Updated": "2024-08-04T11:56:51.801Z",
  "Description": "During RSA key generation, bignum implementations used a variation of the Binary Extended Euclidean Algorithm which entailed significantly input-dependent flow. This allowed an attacker able to perform electromagnetic-based side channel attacks to record traces leading to the recovery of the secret primes. *Note:* An unmodified Firefox browser does not generate RSA keys in normal operation and is not affected, but products built on top of it might. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 78.",
