  "Description": "A buffer overflow, as described in CVE-2020-8927, exists in the embedded Brotli library.\u00a0 Versions of IO::Compress::Brotli prior to 0.007 included a version of the brotli library prior to version 1.0.8, where an attacker controlling the input length of a \"one-shot\" decompression request to a script can trigger a crash, which happens when copying over chunks of data larger than 2 GiB. It is recommended to update your IO::Compress::Brotli module to 0.007\u00a0or later. If one cannot update, we recommend to use the \"streaming\" API as opposed to the \"one-shot\" API, and impose chunk size limits.",
