  "Description": "tindy2013 subconverter 0.6.4 has a /sub?target=%TARGET%&url=%URL%&config=%CONFIG% API endpoint that accepts an arbitrary %URL% value and launches a GET request for it, but does not consider that the external request target may indirectly redirect back to this original /sub endpoint. Thus, a request loop and a denial of service may occur.",
