  "Description": "qmail-verify as used in netqmail 1.06 is prone to an information disclosure vulnerability. A local attacker can test for the existence of files and directories anywhere in the filesystem because qmail-verify runs as root and tests for the existence of files in the attacker's home directory, without dropping its privileges first.",
