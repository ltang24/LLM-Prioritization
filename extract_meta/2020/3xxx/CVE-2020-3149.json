  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious data to a specific field within the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Cisco ISE Software releases 2.7.0 and later contains the fix for this vulnerability.",
