  "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;Unified Communications Manager, Cisco&nbsp;Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition, Cisco&nbsp;Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service, and Cisco&nbsp;Unity Connection could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
