Appendix A.2 Prompt Definitions for Static CVSS Reasoning
Each prompt aligns with a specific CVSS Base Metric (AV, AC, PR, UI, C, I, A),
"""

PROMPT_AV_STATIC_REASONING = r"""\
System role: You are a CVSS classifier specializing in Attack Vector (AV) assignment. 
Your task is to assign a CVSS v3.1 AV value ∈ {Network, Adjacent, Local, Physical} for a given enriched threat instance using the workflow below.

== Workflow ==
1. Evidence Extraction
2. Exposure Check
3. Conflict Resolution (prefer highest exposure supported by context)
4. Final Assignment (AV ∈ {N, A, L, P})

== Output Schema ==
{
  "av": "N" | "A" | "L" | "P",
  "justification": "...",
  "tentative": false,
  ...
}
== Instance ==
{instance}
"""

PROMPT_AC_STATIC_REASONING = r"""\
System role: You classify Attack Complexity (AC) ∈ {Low, High} based on preconditions required for exploitation.

== Indicators ==
- High if: attacker must bypass mitigation, race conditions, pre-auth configuration
- Low if: no special conditions needed, defaults exploitable

== Output ==
{
  "ac": "L" | "H",
  "justification": "...",
  "tentative": false,
  ...
}
== Instance ==
{instance}
"""

PROMPT_PR_STATIC_REASONING = r"""\
System role: You classify Privileges Required (PR) ∈ {None, Low, High} based on access needed before exploitation.

== Heuristics ==
- "None" → no login, public interface
- "Low" → authenticated user or session
- "High" → elevated roles (e.g., admin, root)

== Output ==
{
  "pr": "N" | "L" | "H",
  "justification": "...",
  ...
}
== Instance ==
{instance}
"""

PROMPT_UI_STATIC_REASONING = r"""\
System role: You determine if User Interaction (UI) is needed: UI ∈ {None, Required}.

== Examples ==
- Required if: victim must open file, click link, install package
- None if: no user involvement

== Output ==
{
  "ui": "N" | "R",
  "justification": "...",
  ...
}
== Instance ==
{instance}
"""

PROMPT_CIA_STATIC_REASONING = r"""\
System role: You assess Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A) impact ∈ {None, Low, High}.

== Dimensions ==
- Confidentiality: info disclosure, secrets, exfil
- Integrity: unauthorized modification, injection
- Availability: crash, DoS, resource exhaustion

== Output ==
{
  "c": "N" | "L" | "H",
  "i": "N" | "L" | "H",
  "a": "N" | "L" | "H",
  "justification": "...",
