        "content": "Based on the provided CVE description for **CVE-2025-4548**, we can analyze the vulnerability using the **CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics**. This vulnerability is a **SQL Injection** in the `Username` parameter of the `/routers/router.php` file in **Campcodes Online Food Ordering System 1.0**, and it can be **exploited remotely**. The exploit is **publicly disclosed**, and the vulnerability is classified as **critical**.\n\n---\n\n### üîê CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Analysis\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Attack Vector (AV):** **Network (N)**\n\n- **Reasoning:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network, as stated: *‚ÄúIt is possible to initiate the attack remotely.‚Äù*\n- **Value:** `AV:N`\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)**\n\n- **Reasoning:** SQL injection vulnerabilities typically do not require any special conditions beyond sending a crafted request. The attacker only needs to manipulate the `Username` parameter. No additional steps or environmental conditions are mentioned.\n- **Value:** `AC:L`\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)**\n\n- **Reasoning:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any privileges to exploit the vulnerability. The injection occurs in a parameter (`Username`) that is likely part of a login or registration form, which is typically accessible to unauthenticated users.\n- **Value:** `PR:N`\n\n---\n\n#### **4. User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)**\n\n- **Reasoning:** There is no indication that a user needs to click a link, open a file, or perform any action for the vulnerability to be exploited. The attacker can send the malicious request directly to the server.\n- **Value:** `UI:N`\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Scope (S):** **Changed (C)**\n\n- **Reasoning:** SQL injection often allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, which can lead to accessing or modifying data across different components (e.g., database, application logic). This means the impact can extend beyond the vulnerable component (`router.php`) to the database, which is in a different security scope.\n- **Value:** `S:C`\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Confidentiality Impact (C):** **High (H)**\n\n- **Reasoning:** A successful SQL injection could allow the attacker to extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials, personal information, or business data.\n- **Value:** `C:H`\n\n---\n\n#### **7. Integrity Impact (I):** **High (H)**\n\n- **Reasoning:** The attacker could modify or delete data in the database, compromising the integrity of the system (e.g., changing orders, prices, or user roles).\n- **Value:** `I:H`\n\n---\n\n#### **8. Availability Impact (A):** **High (H)**\n\n- **Reasoning:** SQL injection can be used to delete tables or perform operations that crash the database or application, leading to denial of service.\n- **Value:** `A:H`\n\n---\n\n### üßÆ Final CVSS v3.1 Vector and Score\n\n**CVSS Vector String:**  \n`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H`\n\n**Base Score:**  \n**10.0 (Critical)**\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ Summary\n\n| Metric               | Value | Reasoning |\n|----------------------|-------|-----------|\n| **Attack Vector**     | N     | Remote exploitation over network |\n| **Attack Complexity** | L     | No special conditions required |\n| **Privileges Required** | N   | No authentication needed |\n| **User Interaction**  | N     | No user interaction required |\n| **Scope**             | C     | Database affected beyond web app |\n| **Confidentiality**   | H     | Data disclosure possible |\n| **Integrity**         | H     | Data modification possible |\n| **Availability**      | H     | System crash or data deletion possible |\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to generate a CVSS report in JSON or vector format for integration into a vulnerability management system.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible PHP script and is triggered by manipulating a parameter named 'Username'. Since the attack can be initiated remotely, the attacker does not need physical access or proximity to the target system. Exploitation can occur over standard internet protocols, such as HTTP, by sending crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoint. This allows attackers to target the system from any location with internet connectivity, significantly broadening the threat landscape and increasing the exposure of the vulnerable component"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation method involves SQL injection through a user-controllable parameter, which is a well-understood and commonly exploited technique. There is no indication that the attacker must bypass any additional defenses, such as input sanitization, authentication gates, or environmental configurations. The vulnerability appears to be present in the default deployment of the application, and the exploit has already been publicly disclosed, suggesting that no special conditions or unpredictable factors are required for successful exploitation"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attack targets a publicly accessible script and manipulates a parameter typically used during login or user identification. There is no mention of the attacker needing to authenticate or possess any form of access credentials prior to launching the exploit. This implies that the attacker can interact with the vulnerable component without any prior access rights, making the system susceptible to compromise by unauthenticated users"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a maliciously crafted request to the server, specifically targeting a parameter in the backend script. There is no indication that a legitimate user must perform any action, such as clicking a link, opening a file, or executing a program, for the exploit to succeed. The attacker can initiate and complete the attack independently, without relying on any user behavior or cooperation"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "This vulnerability is confined to the /routers/router.php component of the Campcodes Online Food Ordering System and involves SQL injection via the 'Username' parameter. Given that SQL injection typically operates within the context of database queries, the exploit may impact the underlying database and its associated data‚Äînot just the router.php file. This implies the attack can cross the security boundary between the web interface and the database backend, elevating its scope beyond a single component. Therefore, exploitation is likely to affect other parts of the system architecture"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The SQL injection vulnerability allows remote attackers to manipulate backend SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data such as user profiles, authentication credentials, order histories, and payment information. Because the 'Username' parameter is commonly tied to login or account lookup functionality, improper sanitization may enable attackers to exfiltrate private user information. This directly compromises the confidentiality of the data stored within the system's database, possibly exposing all users' personal information to unauthorized parties"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection attacks frequently allow data manipulation, not just data extraction. In this case, an attacker could exploit the 'Username' parameter to alter SQL logic, which may result in unauthorized modification of user records, insertion of fraudulent transactions, deletion of existing data, or corruption of system configuration tables. Since the vulnerability exists in a central routing script, any malformed input could redirect logic to vulnerable queries, making data integrity highly susceptible to compromise"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While SQL injection primarily threatens confidentiality and integrity, in certain scenarios‚Äîespecially where attackers inject commands that lock or crash the database‚Äîavailability can also be severely impacted. An attacker might use resource-heavy queries, trigger denial-of-service via malformed queries, or corrupt table structures to interrupt backend functionality. This could lead to partial or complete outage of food ordering services, causing performance degradation or denial of access for legitimate users"
