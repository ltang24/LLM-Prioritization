Here's a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4658**, which affects the OpenPubkey library and OPKSSH authentication mechanism [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4658) [[1]](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4658) [[2]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4658):\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 CVSS v3.1 Vector: `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`\n**Base Score: 9.8 (Critical)**\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Exploitability Metrics\n\n| Metric | Value | Reasoning |\n|--------|-------|-----------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)** | **Network (N)** | Exploitation occurs remotely via specially crafted JWS sent over the network. No physical or local access is required. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)** | No special conditions or environmental factors are needed. The vulnerability is reliably exploitable with a crafted payload. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None (N)** | The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to exploit the flaw. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)** | No user involvement is required; the attack is fully automated and passive from the victim’s perspective. |\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 Scope Metric\n\n| Metric | Value | Reasoning |\n|--------|-------|-----------|\n| **Scope (S)** | **Unchanged (U)** | The vulnerable component (OpenPubkey) and the impacted component (OPKSSH) are tightly coupled in the same trust boundary. The exploit does not cause a change in scope. |\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 Impact Metrics\n\n| Metric | Value | Reasoning |\n|--------|-------|-----------|\n| **Confidentiality (C)** | **High (H)** | Bypassing authentication can expose sensitive system data or allow unauthorized access to protected resources. |\n| **Integrity (I)** | **High (H)** | Attackers can impersonate users or inject malicious commands, compromising data integrity. |\n| **Availability (A)** | **High (H)** | Full authentication bypass could allow attackers to disrupt services or gain persistent access, affecting system availability. |\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Summary\n\nThis vulnerability is **critical** due to its:\n- Remote exploitability\n- Lack of required privileges or user interaction\n- Severe impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability\n\nIt enables attackers to bypass authentication entirely, which is one of the most dangerous classes of vulnerabilities in secure systems.\n\nWould you like a breakdown of the CVSS v4.0 metrics too? Or maybe help drafting a mitigation advisory?\n\n\n\n> [0] [NVD - CVE-2025-4658](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4658)\n>\n> [1] [CVE-2025-4658 Impact, Exploitability, and Mitigation Steps | Wiz](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4658)\n>\n> [2] [CVE-2025-4658 - Vulnerability Details - OpenCVE](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4658)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in OpenPubkey allows an attacker to craft a malicious JSON Web Signature that bypasses cryptographic verification. Since OPKSSH relies on OpenPubkey for authentication, this flaw can be exploited remotely by submitting a forged authentication token to a system using OPKSSH. No physical proximity or internal network access is required; the attacker only needs the ability to transmit data to the target system, such as through an exposed SSH service configured to use OPKSSH for identity verification."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploitation of this vulnerability does not depend on environmental factors or specific configurations outside the attacker’s control. The flaw lies in the signature verification logic itself, meaning that any system using a vulnerable version of OpenPubkey or OPKSSH is susceptible without requiring additional setup. The attacker simply needs to generate a specially crafted JWS that bypasses the verification process, which can be done consistently across affected systems without needing to manipulate external conditions."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker does not need to possess any pre-existing access rights or credentials on the target system. The authentication bypass occurs during the initial verification phase, allowing the attacker to impersonate a valid user without prior authorization. This means the attacker can initiate the exploit from a completely unauthenticated state, leveraging the flawed signature validation to gain access without any legitimate privileges."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not require any action or involvement from a legitimate user. The attacker can independently craft and submit the malicious JWS to the target system, and the vulnerability will trigger during automated authentication handling. There is no need for a user to click links, open files, or perform any other interaction for the exploit to succeed, making it a fully autonomous attack vector."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in OpenPubkey affects OPKSSH, a dependent component that relies on OpenPubkey for authentication. This indicates a 'changed' scope because exploitation of the flaw in OpenPubkey allows an attacker to bypass authentication in OPKSSH, thereby impacting a separate component outside the original security boundary. The authentication bypass cascades from the library to the application, demonstrating a clear breach of component isolation and a cross-boundary security impact."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "By bypassing OPKSSH authentication, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to systems or services protected by SSH, potentially exposing sensitive data such as private keys, configuration files, or user credentials. Since OPKSSH is used to secure remote access, the compromise could lead to full visibility into confidential information managed by the target system. This aligns with a 'high' confidentiality impact under CVSS v3.1, as unauthorized disclosure of critical data is likely."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Authentication bypass enables an attacker to impersonate legitimate users and execute commands or modify files on the target system. This could result in unauthorized changes to system configurations, injection of malicious code, or tampering with logs and data. The ability to alter system state without detection or authorization constitutes a 'high' integrity impact, as it undermines trust in the system’s data and operational correctness."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Once authenticated, an attacker could disrupt services by executing denial-of-service attacks, consuming system resources, or deleting essential files. The vulnerability allows full access, which could be exploited to degrade performance or render services unavailable. Given the potential for complete service disruption through unauthorized access, the availability impact is considered 'high' under CVSS v3.1 guidelines."
