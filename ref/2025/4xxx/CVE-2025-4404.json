Here's a full CVSS v3.1 Base Score analysis of **CVE-2025-4404** based on its description, with detailed reasoning for each metric:\n\n---\n\n### üîç CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Breakdown\n\n| **Metric**                  | **Value**     | **Justification** |\n|----------------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)**     | **Network (N)** | Exploitation occurs over the network‚ÄîKerberos authentication is remotely accessible, and attackers can impersonate admin via a crafted service. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)**     | No specialized conditions are needed; the vulnerability exists due to a default misconfiguration in FreeIPA, making it easy to exploit once known. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **Low (L)**  | An attacker only needs the ability to create a service (a low-level privilege) to carry out the exploit. No admin or domain-level access required beforehand. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)**  | **None (N)**    | No user involvement is necessary. The attacker can perform the exploit autonomously. |\n| **Scope (S)**              | **Changed (C)** | The attacker escalates from local service creation to controlling domain-wide resources‚Äîa significant boundary change. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)**    | **High (H)**    | The attacker gains access to sensitive admin credentials (admin@REALM), enabling full domain data access and exfiltration. |\n| **Integrity (I)**          | **High (H)**    | With domain admin privileges, the attacker can modify, create, or delete any domain objects and data. |\n| **Availability (A)**       | **High (H)**    | Domain-wide control enables potential denial of service, service deactivation, or complete lockout of legitimate users. |\n\n---\n\n### üìä CVSS Base Score Calculation\n\nUsing the values above, the CVSS v3.1 calculator would generate a **Base Score of 9.9 (Critical)** ‚Äî just shy of 10.0 due to the low privilege requirement and lack of user interaction, combined with complete domain compromise.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like to generate a CVSS vector string or calculate this in comparison with similar vulnerabilities!",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited by interacting with the FreeIPA service to create a service principal that mimics the canonical name of the REALM administrator. This process does not require physical access to the host system and can be initiated remotely, provided the attacker has access to the FreeIPA interface or API. The ability to impersonate the admin account through Kerberos ticket generation implies that the attacker can operate from a separate system, potentially over a network, without needing to be co-located with the target environment."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploitation hinges on the FreeIPA system failing to enforce uniqueness of the krbCanonicalName attribute. This flaw is present by default, meaning no special configurations or environmental conditions need to be altered for the attack to succeed. The attacker does not need to manipulate timing, race conditions, or external dependencies. The only prerequisite is the ability to create a service with a specific canonical name, which is a straightforward operation if the system lacks proper validation."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have access to create or register a service within the FreeIPA environment. This implies that the attacker already possesses some level of authenticated access to the system, such as a user or service account with provisioning capabilities. The attacker cannot exploit the flaw anonymously or without prior access; they must be able to interact with the system in a way that allows service creation, which typically requires a defined set of permissions."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not rely on any actions from a human user beyond the attacker. Once the attacker creates the service with the duplicated canonical name, the system itself issues a Kerberos ticket containing the admin credential. There is no need for a victim to click, approve, or otherwise engage with the attacker‚Äôs actions. The compromise is fully automated once the malicious service is registered, and the system processes the ticket request."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in FreeIPA allows a user to impersonate the REALM admin by creating a service with a duplicate krbCanonicalName. This results in privilege escalation from host to domain, enabling the attacker to perform administrative actions across the entire REALM. Since the impact extends beyond the vulnerable FreeIPA component to other domain-wide resources and services, this constitutes a scope change. The attack crosses security boundaries by affecting components outside the original trust domain of the vulnerable service"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "By obtaining a Kerberos ticket with the admin@REALM credential, an attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive domain-wide data. This includes potentially confidential user information, authentication credentials, and configuration data managed by FreeIPA. The ability to impersonate the REALM admin means the attacker can access any resource protected by Kerberos authentication, leading to a complete compromise of confidentiality within the domain"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "With administrative privileges over the REALM, the attacker can modify critical configuration settings, user attributes, access controls, and service definitions. This undermines the integrity of the domain‚Äôs identity and access management infrastructure. The attacker could also inject malicious entries, alter audit logs, or corrupt system policies, resulting in widespread data tampering and loss of trust in the system‚Äôs integrity"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The attacker‚Äôs ability to impersonate the REALM admin could be used to disrupt services by revoking access, deleting critical entries, or misconfiguring domain components. Such actions may lead to denial of service for legitimate users, performance degradation, or even complete domain outages. The vulnerability thus poses a high risk to the availability of FreeIPA and dependent services across the domain"
