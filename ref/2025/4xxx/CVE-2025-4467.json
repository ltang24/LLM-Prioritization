SQL injection typically requires only knowledge of the input parameters [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4467). |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None (N)** | The attacker does not need to be authenticated or possess any privileges to exploit the vulnerability. The injection occurs via public-facing parameters [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4467). |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)** | No user interaction is required. The attacker can directly send malicious requests to the server without needing a victim to perform any action [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4467). |\n| **Scope (S)** | **Unchanged (U)** | The vulnerability affects the same security scope (i.e., the web application itself). There’s no indication that it impacts other components or systems beyond its boundary [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4467). |\n| **Confidentiality Impact (C)** | **High (H)** | Successful exploitation of SQL injection can lead to full database disclosure, including sensitive user data such as emails, names, and potentially credentials [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4467). |\n| **Integrity Impact (I)** | **High (H)** | SQL injection can allow modification or deletion of database records, compromising the integrity of stored data [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4467). |\n| **Availability Impact (A)** | **High (H)** | Attackers could potentially execute queries that crash the database or make the application unavailable, especially if they drop tables or lock resources [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4467). |\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 CVSS Vector and Score\n\n- **Vector String**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`\n- **Base Score**: **9.8 (Critical)** [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4467)\n\nThis score reflects the severity of a remotely exploitable SQL injection vulnerability with no required privileges or user interaction, and with full impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\nWould you like to explore how this score compares to other vulnerabilities in the same software or category?\n\n\n\n> [0] [NVD - CVE-2025-4467](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4467)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible administrative script, specifically /admin/edit-admin.php, which processes user-supplied parameters. Because the attack can be initiated remotely and targets a publicly reachable endpoint, an attacker does not need physical access or proximity to the system. Exploitation can occur over standard internet protocols, such as HTTP, allowing attackers to craft malicious requests from any location with network connectivity. This remote accessibility significantly broadens the threat landscape, enabling exploitation from virtually anywhere without requiring direct interaction with the host environment"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The vulnerability involves SQL injection through direct manipulation of input parameters like id, txtfullname, txtemail, and cmddesignation. There is no indication of prerequisite conditions such as specific server configurations, timing constraints, or environmental dependencies that would complicate exploitation. The exploit appears to rely solely on the attacker’s ability to send crafted input to the vulnerable endpoint. This suggests that the conditions required for successful exploitation are minimal and do not depend on unpredictable or external factors beyond the attacker’s control"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerable script is part of the administrative interface, but the exploit targets input parameters without requiring prior authentication or elevated access. The description indicates that the attack can be initiated remotely and has already been publicly disclosed, implying that the attacker does not need to log in or possess any special permissions to reach the vulnerable code. This means the attacker can exploit the flaw without first gaining access to the system or assuming any user role, making it accessible to unauthenticated actors"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "There is no mention of any requirement for a legitimate user to perform actions such as clicking links, opening files, or interacting with the system in a way that would trigger the exploit. The SQL injection occurs through direct manipulation of HTTP parameters, which can be executed entirely by the attacker. This indicates that the compromise does not depend on any user behavior or cooperation, and the attacker can carry out the exploit independently without relying on social engineering or user-triggered events"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in the SourceCodester Online Student Clearance System 1.0 affects the /admin/edit-admin.php file, which is part of the administrative component of the system. Given that the vulnerability is an SQL injection, it can potentially affect the database, which is a separate component from the web application itself. This means that the scope is changed because the vulnerability allows an attacker to impact resources beyond the immediate component, specifically the database, which is outside the initial security scope of the web application interface"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The confidentiality impact of this SQL injection vulnerability is significant. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could potentially access sensitive data stored in the database, such as user information, administrative records, or other confidential data managed by the system. Since the attack can be initiated remotely and the exploit is publicly disclosed, the risk of unauthorized data access is high, leading to a severe impact on confidentiality"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The integrity impact of this SQL injection vulnerability is also severe. An attacker could manipulate the database by altering, inserting, or deleting records. This could lead to corruption of data, unauthorized changes to user or administrative information, and potentially the insertion of malicious data. Such actions would compromise the integrity of the information stored in the system, making it unreliable and potentially harmful"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The availability impact of this vulnerability is considerable. By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker could execute queries that degrade the performance of the database, potentially leading to denial of service conditions. For instance, executing resource-intensive queries or causing database locks could make the system unavailable to legitimate users, thus affecting the overall availability of the service"
