        "content": "Here's a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metric analysis for **CVE-2025-4567**, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Post Slider and Carousel with Widget WordPress plugin:\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Attack Vector (AV): **Network (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability is exploitable via a web interface (WordPress admin dashboard), which is accessible over the network. Even though the attacker must be authenticated, the attack is still carried out remotely through HTTP(S) requests.\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 Attack Complexity (AC): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: No special conditions or unpredictable factors are required. The attacker simply needs to insert a malicious payload into a widget field (e.g., `Query Offset`) and save it. The XSS is triggered when the page is rendered or the widget is edited [[0]](https://research.cleantalk.org/CVE-2025-4567/).\n\n---\n\n### 👤 Privileges Required (PR): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker must have at least **Contributor** privileges to access and configure the vulnerable widget. This level of access is considered “Low” in CVSS, as it does not require administrative or elevated privileges [[0]](https://research.cleantalk.org/CVE-2025-4567/).\n\n---\n\n### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User Interaction (UI): **Required (R)**\n- **Reasoning**: The XSS payload is triggered when another user (e.g., an admin) interacts with the widget—such as hovering over the field. This means exploitation depends on user behavior, satisfying the “Required” condition [[0]](https://research.cleantalk.org/CVE-2025-4567/).\n\n---\n\n### 🧱 Scope (S): **Unchanged (U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability affects the same security authority (WordPress plugin environment). It does not lead to a compromise of other components or systems beyond the plugin itself.\n\n---\n\n### 💥 Confidentiality (C): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: Stored XSS can expose sensitive data such as cookies or session tokens if exploited cleverly. However, the impact is limited to what the malicious script can access within the browser context.\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 Integrity (I): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker can modify content displayed to users (e.g., inject scripts or misleading information), but cannot alter server-side data or core plugin functionality.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ Availability (A): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability does not affect system availability. It does not crash the site or prevent access to resources.\n\n---\n\n### 📊 Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score: **3.5 (Low)**\nThis score reflects a low-severity issue due to the need for authentication and user interaction, despite the potential for persistent script execution [[0]](https://research.cleantalk.org/CVE-2025-4567/).\n\nLet me know if you'd like help calculating the Temporal or Environmental scores too!\n\n\n\n> [0] [CVE-2025-4567 - Post Slider and Carousel with Widget < 3.2.10 - Stored ...](https://research.cleantalk.org/CVE-2025-4567/)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by embedding malicious payloads into the widget options of the plugin. Since the plugin's functionality is designed to output content on web pages, an attacker does not need physical access to the server or local environment. Exploitation occurs through the web interface, making it accessible over a network connection, such as the internet or an intranet, depending on the WordPress site's configuration"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploitation requires specific conditions to be met, such as the attacker knowing how to craft a malicious payload that leverages the lack of validation and escaping in the widget options. However, no additional configurations or environmental factors, such as specific server settings or third-party dependencies, are needed beyond the vulnerable plugin being installed and active on the target WordPress site"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker must have a user account with at least contributor-level permissions on the WordPress site. This level of access allows the attacker to add or modify content, including embedding the vulnerable widget with malicious payloads. Without this level of access, exploitation is not possible"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "For the attack to succeed, another user, such as an administrator or a visitor, must view the page or post containing the maliciously crafted widget. This interaction triggers the execution of the malicious payload, making user participation a necessary component of the exploitation process"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability stems from improper output escaping in widget options, which is exploitable by users with contributor roles and above. While the flaw resides in a specific plugin component, the resulting stored XSS may execute arbitrary JavaScript within affected pages viewed by higher-privileged users, such as administrators. This allows the exploit to cross privilege boundaries and potentially impact the broader WordPress site configuration and administrative components. Thus, the Scope is changed due to the ability to escalate impact beyond the initial plugin’s domain"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "Exploitation of stored XSS enables attackers to inject scripts that run in the context of administrators viewing compromised pages. These scripts can steal sensitive session tokens, authentication cookies, or other private data available in the admin interface. This puts site-wide configuration data and potentially user PII (e.g., email addresses, post content) at risk, making the confidentiality impact high even if the widget itself doesn’t directly store such data. The attacker leverages the trust level of the admin user to access protected resources"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Attackers leveraging the XSS vulnerability can modify page contents, add unauthorized posts, change plugin configurations, or even install malicious plugins by hijacking the administrator's session. Since the injected JavaScript operates with the privileges of the affected user, it can tamper with WordPress database contents or site appearance without detection. Therefore, the integrity impact is significant, as both site content and operational settings can be manipulated in unauthorized ways"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Although stored XSS primarily targets confidentiality and integrity, it could also impact availability. Malicious scripts may create denial-of-service conditions by redirecting users, crashing browser sessions, or even altering critical configurations that affect plugin performance or content rendering. In some cases, automated malicious payloads could overload server-side resources. Hence, while availability isn’t the primary target, its degradation is a plausible consequence, especially if administrative functions are disrupted"
