      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to initiate exploitation over a network interface without requiring physical access or proximity. Since the attack can be performed remotely via manipulation of a web request parameter, it indicates that the attacker does not need local access or to be within the same local network segment, making the attack feasible from a distant location through standard network channels."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability involves sending a specially crafted request that manipulates the input parameter associated with the database query. No additional complex conditions, such as specific system configurations, timing constraints, or multi-step processes, are necessary beyond the ability to send malicious input. The attack relies solely on the attacker’s ability to craft and deliver the malicious request, which is straightforward once the vulnerability is known."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any prior access rights or user credentials on the system to exploit the vulnerability. Since the attack is performed remotely via a web interface and does not depend on existing user privileges, the attacker can initiate the attack without any authentication or elevated permissions. The attack leverages a flaw in input handling that is accessible to unauthenticated users."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not require any action or participation from legitimate users of the system beyond the attacker’s own efforts to send malicious requests. No human user within the target environment needs to open or interact with malicious content or perform any specific operation; the attack can be carried out automatically by the attacker without involving other users or their actions."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in the /view_drive.php component and is triggered via SQL injection through the 'ID' parameter. Based on CVSS v3.1 definitions, the scope remains unchanged because the exploit affects only the vulnerable component itself (the Placement Management System) and does not cross into other security domains such as the operating system or database management system. There is no indication that exploitation leads to privilege escalation or impacts resources outside the original security authority of the web application"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection vulnerabilities often allow attackers to manipulate backend queries, potentially exposing sensitive data stored in the database. In this case, the attacker could retrieve confidential placement records, user details, or other internal data managed by the system. However, the CVSS vector indicates a 'Low' confidentiality impact, suggesting that while some data may be exposed, it is not critical or highly sensitive, or the volume of exposed data is limited"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The ability to inject SQL commands through the 'ID' parameter could allow an attacker to alter or delete records in the database. This compromises the integrity of the system’s data, such as modifying placement schedules or corrupting user profiles. The CVSS vector assigns a 'Low' integrity impact, implying that while data modification is possible, it is either limited in scope or does not significantly affect the system’s trustworthiness or operational correctness"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection can be used to execute commands that degrade system performance or cause denial of service, such as dropping tables or locking database resources. In this case, the CVSS vector indicates a 'Low' availability impact, meaning the vulnerability may cause some performance degradation or temporary disruption but does not render the system completely unavailable or unusable for extended periods"
