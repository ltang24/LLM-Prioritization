        "content": "Here‚Äôs a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4701**, based on the official definitions and the provided vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### üß≠ Attack Vector (AV): **Local (AV:L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability is exploitable on the local host, meaning the attacker must have access to the system where the vulnerable component resides. This excludes remote or network-based exploitation.\n\n---\n\n### ‚öôÔ∏è Attack Complexity (AC): **Low (AC:L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability arises from deserialization via `torch.load` when the `path` argument is manipulated. No special conditions or environmental factors are required beyond supplying a malicious file path, making exploitation straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### üîê Privileges Required (PR): **Low (PR:L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker likely needs permission to execute code or access the vulnerable function locally, but not full administrative rights. This suggests low-level privileges are sufficient to exploit the flaw.\n\n---\n\n### üë§ User Interaction (UI): **None (UI:N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The description does not mention any need for another user to trigger the vulnerability. If the attacker can directly invoke `torch.load` with a crafted path, no user interaction is required.\n\n---\n\n### üîÑ Scope (S): **Unchanged (S:U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability affects the component in which it resides (i.e., the Python module using `torch.load`). There‚Äôs no indication that it impacts other components or crosses security boundaries.\n\n---\n\n### üïµÔ∏è Confidentiality Impact (C): **Low (C:L)**\n- **Reasoning**: Deserialization vulnerabilities can expose sensitive data if malicious objects are loaded. However, unless the deserialized object directly accesses confidential information, the impact is limited.\n\n---\n\n### üßæ Integrity Impact (I): **Low (I:L)**\n- **Reasoning**: Malicious deserialization can lead to data manipulation or unauthorized changes. In this case, the attacker may influence the behavior of the application, but not necessarily compromise its core integrity.\n\n---\n\n### üö´ Availability Impact (A): **None (A:N)**\n- **Reasoning**: There‚Äôs no indication that the vulnerability causes crashes, hangs, or denial of service. The issue appears limited to deserialization logic without affecting system availability.\n\n---\n\n### üßÆ Summary Vector\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N\n```\n\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like help calculating the score or exploring mitigation strategies!",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is exploitable through the manipulation of a file path argument passed to the torch.load function, which implies that the attacker must have access to the system where the vulnerable code is executed. This access could be achieved through direct interaction with the host environment, such as placing a malicious file in a location that the application will read. The exploit does not require remote connectivity or exposure to external networks, but rather relies on the attacker‚Äôs ability to influence local file operations, suggesting proximity to the target system is necessary"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploitation of this vulnerability depends on the application invoking torch.load with a path that the attacker can control. This may require the application to be configured in a way that accepts user-supplied file paths or loads files from directories accessible to untrusted users. The attacker must ensure that the malicious file is formatted correctly to trigger unsafe deserialization. These conditions are not inherently complex but do depend on specific application behavior and deployment configurations that allow such file access and execution paths"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to place or modify files on the system in a location that the vulnerable torch.load function will access. This typically requires some level of access to the file system, such as write permissions in a shared directory or the ability to influence input parameters. The attacker does not need administrative control but must possess sufficient rights to affect the execution context of the vulnerable function, which may vary depending on how the application is deployed and secured"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not inherently require another user to perform an action such as clicking a link or opening a file. However, if the vulnerable function is triggered by user behavior‚Äîsuch as uploading a file or initiating a model load‚Äîthen indirect user involvement may be necessary. In cases where the application automatically loads files without user prompting, the attack could proceed without any human interaction beyond the attacker‚Äôs actions. The need for user participation depends on how the vulnerable code is integrated into the broader application workflow"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability involves deserialization through manipulation of the argument passed to torch.load in models/utils.py. Since torch.load is commonly used to load model parameters or configurations, exploiting this locally could execute arbitrary code within the application's security scope. However, there is no indication that it affects other components outside the VITA-MLLM Freeze-Omni framework. Thus, the impact likely remains confined to the affected component's security boundary"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "Deserialization vulnerabilities may allow attackers to inject arbitrary objects or execute malicious payloads, potentially giving access to sensitive information stored in memory, files, or variables at runtime. In this case, if torch.load is manipulated to access unintended paths, attackers might read unauthorized local files or memory contents, risking disclosure of credentials, model data, or internal configurations. The impact is localized but could compromise confidentiality within the host environment"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "By exploiting deserialization, attackers could tamper with the deserialized data structures, altering model weights, logic, or control flow. If malicious inputs are crafted and loaded via torch.load, system behavior may be corrupted without detection, leading to modified outputs or misrepresentation of model inference. The ability to control what is loaded poses a notable threat to the integrity of computational results and data used by the model"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "If an attacker leverages this flaw to load malicious or malformed data via torch.load, the deserialization process may cause runtime crashes or infinite loops depending on the payload. Such disruptions could result in denial of service conditions, halting inference or training operations. Moreover, repeated exploitation could exhaust system resources, degrading performance or causing system instability until remediation is applied"
