        "content": "Here’s a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metric analysis for **CVE-2025-4414**, a Local File Inclusion vulnerability in the CMSMasters Content Composer WordPress plugin (versions < 2.5.7), based on the official CVSS definitions and available data [[0]](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4414) [[1]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4414) [[2]](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/cmsmasters-content-composer/cmsmasters-content-composer-257-unauthenticated-local-file-inclusion):\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 CVSS Vector: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`\n\n| **Metric**               | **Value** | **Reasoning** |\n|--------------------------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)**   | Network (N) | Exploitation occurs remotely via HTTP requests to the vulnerable plugin. No physical or local access is required. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | High (H) | Although unauthenticated, successful exploitation likely requires crafting specific input or knowledge of file paths, which adds complexity. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | None (N) | The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any privileges on the target system. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | None (N) | No user action is required for the attack to succeed. The vulnerability is triggered solely by the attacker’s request. |\n| **Scope (S)**            | Unchanged (U) | The impact is confined to the vulnerable plugin’s security authority. It does not affect other components or systems. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)**  | High (H) | Sensitive files such as database credentials can be exposed, potentially leading to full data compromise. |\n| **Integrity (I)**        | High (H) | If the attacker can include and execute arbitrary local files, they may alter application behavior or inject malicious code. |\n| **Availability (A)**     | High (H) | Inclusion of certain files could crash the application or disrupt service, especially if system-critical files are accessed. |\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Summary\n\nThis vulnerability scores **8.1 (High)** due to its remote exploitability, lack of required privileges, and potential for serious impact across confidentiality, integrity, and availability. While the attack complexity is high, the absence of user interaction and authentication requirements makes it a significant threat—especially for publicly accessible WordPress sites [[0]](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4414) [[2]](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/cmsmasters-content-composer/cmsmasters-content-composer-257-unauthenticated-local-file-inclusion).\n\nWould you like help crafting a mitigation plan or generating a report for stakeholders?\n\n\n\n> [0] [CVE-2025-4414 Impact, Exploitability, and Mitigation Steps | Wiz](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4414)\n>\n> [1] [CVE-2025-4414 - NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4414)\n>\n> [2] [CMSMasters Content Composer < 2.5.7 - Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/cmsmasters-content-composer/cmsmasters-content-composer-257-unauthenticated-local-file-inclusion)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability exists within a web application component that processes user-supplied input to include files during execution. Exploitation requires an attacker to send specially crafted requests over the network to the web server hosting the application, enabling remote initiation of the attack without physical access or local presence. Since the attacker can influence the server through standard network communication channels, the attack can be performed remotely over the internet or other networked environments."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability involves manipulating the filename parameter used in include or require statements within the PHP application. The attacker must craft a specific input that the application improperly handles, such as a malicious URL or parameter that points to a local file. No additional complex conditions, such as bypassing authentication or specific configurations, are necessary beyond the ability to send a valid request. The attack relies on the application's failure to validate or sanitize user input, making the exploitation straightforward once the vulnerability exists."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web server that processes user input for file inclusion. This typically requires at least the ability to access the web interface or API endpoint that accepts user input for file paths. The attacker does not need any prior authentication or elevated permissions within the application or server environment; the attack can be carried out by an unauthenticated user who can interact with the vulnerable interface. Therefore, the attacker’s privileges are minimal, limited to the ability to communicate with the server through the web interface."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attacker can initiate the exploitation solely through automated or malicious requests sent to the server without requiring any action or participation from other users. The attack does not depend on any other individual’s input or actions; it is triggered by the attacker’s crafted request. The vulnerability allows remote code inclusion based on the attacker’s input, meaning no human user other than the attacker needs to be involved or aware of the attack process for it to succeed."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in the CMSMasters Content Composer allows for Local File Inclusion (LFI), which can potentially affect resources beyond the immediate component. If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to include files from the local file system into the web application. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files or execution of unintended scripts, thus impacting other components or services that rely on the integrity and security of the CMSMasters Content Composer. The scope is likely to be changed as the impact can extend beyond the vulnerable component itself"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The confidentiality impact of this vulnerability is significant because Local File Inclusion can allow an attacker to access sensitive files on the server. This might include configuration files, database credentials, or other sensitive information stored on the server. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially read files that should not be publicly accessible, leading to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The integrity impact is also considerable as Local File Inclusion could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code if they can include files that are writable and executable. This could lead to unauthorized modifications of files or data on the server, potentially altering the behavior of the application or corrupting data. The ability to manipulate the file system or application logic poses a serious threat to the integrity of the system"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The availability impact of this vulnerability is moderate. While Local File Inclusion primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, it could also lead to denial of service conditions if critical files are included inappropriately, causing the application to crash or behave unexpectedly. Additionally, if an attacker can execute scripts through included files, they might consume server resources, leading to performance degradation or service disruption"
