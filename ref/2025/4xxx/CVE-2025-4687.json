        "content": "Sure! Here's a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4687**, based on the vulnerability description and official metric definitions:\n\n---\n\n### üîç CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Analysis\n\n| **Metric**               | **Value**     | **Reasoning** |\n|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)**   | **Network**   | Exploitation occurs via a web interface over the internet. The attacker sends an invitation link remotely, requiring no physical or local access. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low**     | No special conditions or unpredictable factors are needed. The attacker simply sends an invite and relies on the victim registering independently. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **Low**   | The attacker must have a valid account to send invites, but no elevated privileges are required to initiate the exploit. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **Required** | The victim must ignore the invite and register manually. This step is essential for the exploit to succeed. |\n| **Scope (S)**            | **Changed**   | The attacker gains control over the victim‚Äôs account and company, affecting resources beyond their own security authority. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)**  | **High**      | The attacker can access sensitive user and company data after takeover. |\n| **Integrity (I)**        | **High**      | The attacker can modify victim account settings and company configurations. |\n| **Availability (A)**     | **High**      | Full control over the victim‚Äôs account and company implies the ability to disrupt or disable services and access. |\n\n---\n\n### üßÆ CVSS Base Score Estimate\n\nUsing the above metrics, the estimated CVSS v3.1 Base Score is **9.1 (Critical)**.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like this broken down into a formal vector string or want to explore environmental or temporal metrics too.",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited through the public-facing web interface of the Teltonika RMS platform. An attacker initiates the exploit by accessing the system remotely via a browser, without needing physical access or proximity to the target. The attacker interacts with the invitation endpoint to send a crafted invite to a future user. This means the attacker can operate from any location with internet access, targeting victims who have not yet registered on the platform."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploit does not rely on unpredictable environmental factors or rare system configurations. The attacker only needs to ensure that the victim has not previously registered on the RMS platform. Once this condition is met, the attacker can send an invitation assigning elevated roles. The system‚Äôs logic flaw automatically associates the victim‚Äôs future account with the attacker‚Äôs organization upon registration. No additional timing constraints, race conditions, or external dependencies complicate the attack."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To initiate the exploit, the attacker must first create a legitimate account on the RMS platform. This account allows access to the invitation functionality, which is typically available to authenticated users. The attacker uses this access to send an invitation to a target email address. While the attacker does not need administrative control over the entire system, they do require sufficient permissions to generate and manage invitations within their own organization context."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The victim must actively participate by registering on the RMS platform using the same email address that received the attacker‚Äôs invitation. This registration step is essential for the exploit to succeed, as it triggers the automatic association of the victim‚Äôs account with the attacker‚Äôs organization. Without the victim completing the registration process, the attacker cannot gain control over the victim‚Äôs account or associated resources."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in Teltonika RMS allows an attacker to manipulate the invite functionality to pre-hijack user accounts. This results in the victim being added to the attacker's company and their account being managed externally. Since the attacker's actions affect not only the victim's account but also the victim's associated company resources, this crosses the security boundary of the original component. The attacker‚Äôs control over another organizational entity implies a change in scope, as the impact extends beyond the initially vulnerable component"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "By gaining control over a victim‚Äôs account and their associated company within RMS, the attacker can potentially access sensitive configuration data, device management settings, and operational logs. These resources may contain proprietary or personal information. Although the vulnerability does not directly expose raw data, the unauthorized access to an account with administrative privileges implies a breach of confidentiality, especially if the attacker can view or extract information managed by the victim‚Äôs company"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The attacker‚Äôs ability to assign administrative roles and manage the victim‚Äôs company means they can alter device configurations, user permissions, and operational parameters. This undermines the integrity of the system by allowing unauthorized modifications to critical data and settings. The victim may not be aware of these changes, which could lead to misconfigurations, security policy violations, or corrupted operational states within the RMS platform"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Once the attacker gains control over the victim‚Äôs account and company, they can potentially disrupt services by altering configurations, revoking access, or mismanaging resources. This could lead to performance degradation or denial of service for legitimate users. The high availability impact is supported by the attacker‚Äôs ability to control operational aspects of the RMS platform, which is used to manage remote devices critical to business continuity [[0]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4687)"
