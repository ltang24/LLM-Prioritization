        "content": "Here is a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4778** based on the provided vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### üß≠ Attack Vector (AV): **Network**\n- **Reasoning:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a web interface (`/normal-search.php`) using a maliciously crafted `searchdata` parameter. No physical or local access is needed.\n\n---\n\n### üéØ Attack Complexity (AC): **Low**\n- **Reasoning:** SQL injection is a well-known attack technique. The description provides no indication of specific environmental factors or configurations that would make the attack harder to perform. No special conditions are required beyond sending crafted input.\n\n---\n\n### üîê Privileges Required (PR): **None**\n- **Reasoning:** The attacker does not need to authenticate or possess any prior access privileges. The injection occurs through a publicly accessible interface without needing login credentials.\n\n---\n\n### üë§ User Interaction (UI): **None**\n- **Reasoning:** The attacker alone performs the exploit by sending malicious input. The user doesn‚Äôt need to click or interact with anything for exploitation to succeed.\n\n---\n\n### üß© Scope (S): **Unchanged**\n- **Reasoning:** There's no evidence suggesting that the attack impacts other components or systems beyond the vulnerable script (`/normal-search.php`). The impact seems confined to the same security authority.\n\n---\n\n### üîí Confidentiality Impact (C): **High**\n- **Reasoning:** SQL injection often grants unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database. The potential for full data exfiltration justifies a high rating for confidentiality loss.\n\n---\n\n### ‚úçÔ∏è Integrity Impact (I): **High**\n- **Reasoning:** SQL injection may allow modification or deletion of data, compromising its accuracy and trustworthiness. This level of access is consistent with a high integrity impact.\n\n---\n\n### üö´ Availability Impact (A): **High**\n- **Reasoning:** Exploitation could allow deletion of data, interruption of queries, or database corruption‚Äîaffecting service availability significantly.\n\n---\n\n### üìä Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score: **9.8 (Critical)**\nThis matches the severity stated in the advisory and reflects a highly impactful vulnerability with minimal barriers to exploitation.\n\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like help calculating the Temporal and Environmental scores too‚Äîor if you're analyzing a different CVE.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker over a network connection without requiring physical access or local system interaction. Since the flaw exists within a web application's script that processes user-supplied input, an attacker can remotely send crafted requests over the internet to trigger the SQL injection, making the attack feasible from any location with network access to the target system."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability involves sending specially crafted input data to the application's search functionality. No special configurations, additional conditions, or complex setups are necessary beyond the attacker having the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The attack relies solely on manipulating user input that the application inadequately sanitizes, thus the exploitation does not depend on complex environmental factors or specific system states."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any prior access privileges or authenticated session to exploit the vulnerability. Since the flaw resides in a publicly accessible search feature that processes user input without proper validation, an attacker can initiate the attack as an anonymous user, requiring no additional permissions or credentials beforehand."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attacker can execute the exploit by directly sending malicious input to the web application's interface. No human user other than the attacker needs to participate or perform any action; the attack does not require the participation or awareness of other users. The malicious request can be automated or scripted, making user interaction unnecessary for successful exploitation."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web application component (/normal-search.php) and involves SQL injection through user-supplied input. Since SQL injection can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary queries within the database, it may enable access to other components or data beyond the immediate scope of the affected script. If the attacker leverages this vulnerability to escalate privileges or access sensitive data across different modules or systems, it indicates a breach of security boundaries, thus impacting the scope by crossing component or system boundaries."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The SQL injection vulnerability can allow an attacker to extract sensitive information stored within the database, such as user data, personal information, or system credentials. Unauthorized data retrieval compromises the confidentiality of information resources managed by the application. Given the critical classification and public disclosure, the attacker could access confidential data that was previously protected, leading to significant confidentiality impacts."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Exploitation of the SQL injection could enable an attacker to modify or delete data within the database, affecting the integrity of stored information. This could include altering user records, transaction data, or configuration settings. Such modifications could undermine trustworthiness, cause data corruption, or facilitate further malicious activities, indicating a high potential for integrity impacts."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While SQL injection primarily affects data confidentiality and integrity, it can also impact availability if exploited to perform actions like database crashes, resource exhaustion, or denial-of-service conditions. For example, an attacker might execute resource-intensive queries or cause database failures, leading to service disruptions or degraded performance of the ticketing system. Therefore, the vulnerability can indirectly or directly impact system availability."
