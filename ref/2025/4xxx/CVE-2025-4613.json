        "content": "Here‚Äôs a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4613**, based on the official definitions and the vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### üß≠ Exploitability Metrics\n\n#### **Attack Vector (AV): Local (L)**\n- **Reasoning:** Exploitation requires the victim to download and open a malicious ad template using the vulnerable application installed on their system. This implies the attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network without user involvement.\n- **Interpretation:** The attacker must have local access or rely on user interaction with a locally stored file.\n\n#### **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning:** No special conditions or configurations are required beyond convincing the user to open a crafted file. The vulnerability stems from improper URL parsing and path traversal, which are straightforward to exploit once the file is opened.\n- **Interpretation:** The attack does not depend on environmental factors or race conditions.\n\n#### **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**\n- **Reasoning:** The attacker does not need any privileges on the victim‚Äôs system. The malicious file is executed within the context of the user running Google Web Designer.\n- **Interpretation:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication or elevated permissions.\n\n#### **User Interaction (UI): Required (R)**\n- **Reasoning:** The victim must download and open the malicious template file. This is a clear case of required user interaction.\n- **Interpretation:** The attack cannot proceed without the user performing an action.\n\n---\n\n### üîç Scope and Impact Metrics\n\n#### **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**\n- **Reasoning:** The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the application itself) and does not cross privilege boundaries or affect other system components.\n- **Interpretation:** The impact is confined to the vulnerable component.\n\n#### **Confidentiality (C): High (H)**\n- **Reasoning:** Remote code execution allows the attacker to access sensitive data on the victim‚Äôs system, potentially exfiltrating files or credentials.\n- **Interpretation:** There is a total loss of confidentiality.\n\n#### **Integrity (I): High (H)**\n- **Reasoning:** Arbitrary file writes and code execution enable the attacker to modify system files or application behavior.\n- **Interpretation:** The attacker can fully compromise data integrity.\n\n#### **Availability (A): High (H)**\n- **Reasoning:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code, potentially disabling the application or system, leading to a complete loss of availability.\n- **Interpretation:** The system or application may become unusable.\n\n---\n\n### üßÆ CVSS Vector and Score\n\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n```\n\n- **Base Score:** 8.8 (High)\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like help calculating the Temporal or Environmental scores, or if you want to compare this CVE with similar ones.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is exploitable through the delivery of a malicious ad template, which implies that the attacker can initiate the exploit remotely by crafting and distributing a specially formed file. Since the flaw lies in how the application parses URLs and handles templates, the attacker does not need physical access to the target machine. Instead, exploitation can occur over digital channels such as email, websites, or ad networks, allowing the attacker to reach victims without being in close proximity or on the same network."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Successful exploitation depends on the application's improper handling of URL paths and template files, which is a predictable and consistent flaw in affected versions. There are no indications that the attacker must rely on environmental factors outside their control, such as race conditions, specific system configurations, or timing constraints. The vulnerability stems from a logic flaw in the client-side parsing mechanism, meaning the attacker can reliably trigger the issue without needing to manipulate external conditions or guess system states."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need to authenticate or possess elevated permissions within the application or operating system to exploit the vulnerability. The attack vector involves sending a crafted template file that the application processes incorrectly, leading to arbitrary file writes and remote code execution. This suggests that the attacker operates without prior access to the system and does not require any user-level or administrative privileges to initiate the exploit."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploit requires the victim to download and open a malicious ad template, which means the user must take an active role in triggering the vulnerability. This interaction could be as simple as clicking a link or importing a file into the application. Without this action, the malicious payload would not be processed by the vulnerable component, and the exploit would not succeed. Therefore, the attack depends on convincing the user to engage with the crafted content."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability remains confined to the Google Web Designer application itself and does not appear to impact other components or systems beyond its security scope. Although remote code execution is achieved via path traversal, the attack is executed entirely within the context of the vulnerable application on the client‚Äôs machine. There is no indication that exploitation crosses privilege boundaries or affects other applications or system-level resources, which aligns with an 'Unchanged' scope rating under CVSS v3.1"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability does not directly expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access to confidential information. While remote code execution could theoretically be leveraged to access files, the exploit mechanism‚Äîarbitrary file writes via path traversal‚Äîdoes not inherently involve reading or disclosing data. Therefore, the impact on confidentiality is minimal and likely rated as 'None' or 'Low' under CVSS v3.1, depending on attacker control post-exploitation"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "This vulnerability allows attackers to perform arbitrary file writes on the client system, which directly compromises the integrity of the affected component. By manipulating file paths, attackers can overwrite legitimate files or introduce malicious ones, potentially altering application behavior or enabling further exploitation. This represents a significant breach of data integrity and warrants a 'High' rating under CVSS v3.1 for integrity impact"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Although the vulnerability enables remote code execution, its primary mechanism‚Äîarbitrary file writes‚Äîdoes not inherently disrupt service availability. There is no evidence of resource exhaustion, denial-of-service conditions, or performance degradation. However, depending on the payload, an attacker could theoretically disable the application or corrupt essential files, leading to partial service disruption. This suggests a 'Low' availability impact under CVSS v3.1"
