        "content": "Let's analyze CVE-2025-4757 step-by-step according to the CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics definitions, using the provided vulnerability description.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Attack Vector (AV)\n\n**Definition:**  \nThe context in which the vulnerability can be exploited. Values: **Network (N)**, **Adjacent Network (A)**, **Local (L)**, **Physical (P)**.\n\n**Vulnerability details:**  \n- The attack can be initiated remotely via manipulation of the `email` argument in `/forgot-password.php`.  \n- Since the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network, no physical or local access is required.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **AV = Network (N)**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Attack Complexity (AC)\n\n**Definition:**  \nConditions beyond the attacker's control that must exist for exploitation. Values: **Low (L)**, **High (H)**.\n\n**Vulnerability details:**  \n- Exploiting the SQL injection appears straightforward, involving sending a crafted request with malicious `email` parameter.  \n- No mention of complex conditions, authentication, or additional steps.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **AC = Low (L)**\n\n---\n\n### 3.

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a publicly accessible web endpoint, specifically the password recovery script. Exploitation involves sending crafted HTTP requests containing malicious input to the 'email' parameter. Since this interaction occurs over standard web protocols and does not require physical access or proximity to the target system, an attacker can initiate the attack from any location with internet connectivity. This remote accessibility significantly broadens the threat landscape, allowing exploitation without direct contact with the vulnerable system"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The attack leverages a SQL injection flaw triggered by manipulating a single input field. No special configurations, environmental conditions, or dependencies are required beyond the application being deployed and reachable. The attacker does not need to bypass any additional security mechanisms or rely on race conditions, timing issues, or specific system states. The simplicity of the input manipulation and the lack of external prerequisites indicate that the conditions for exploitation are straightforward and consistent across deployments"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerable functionality is part of the password recovery process, which is typically exposed to unauthenticated users. The attacker can interact with the endpoint without logging in or possessing any credentials. This means the attacker does not need to escalate privileges or gain access to restricted areas of the application before launching the exploit. The ability to exploit the flaw without any prior access to the system significantly increases the risk and ease of attack"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not rely on any actions from legitimate users. The attacker directly interacts with the vulnerable endpoint by submitting malicious input, and the system processes this input without requiring a user to click links, open files, or perform any other tasks. The absence of user involvement means the attacker can execute the exploit autonomously, without needing to trick or engage a victim in any way"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides within the /forgot-password.php component of the PHPGurukul system, which handles password reset functionality. Since SQL injection can be exploited remotely and may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary queries on the database, it can potentially affect other components or data beyond the immediate scope. If the attacker leverages this to access or modify data outside the intended boundaries, the scope extends beyond the original component, impacting resources across the system's security boundary."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The SQL injection vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate database queries through the email parameter, which could lead to unauthorized data access. This may include retrieving sensitive user information such as email addresses, personal details, or other stored confidential data. The potential for data disclosure directly compromises the confidentiality of information managed by the application, especially if the attacker extracts sensitive records from the database."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Exploiting the SQL injection could enable an attacker to modify or corrupt database records, such as resetting passwords, altering user data, or injecting malicious data. This undermines the integrity of the stored information, potentially leading to unauthorized changes that can affect system behavior, user trust, and data consistency. The attacker’s ability to manipulate database content signifies a significant impact on data integrity."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While the primary impact of this vulnerability is on confidentiality and integrity, a successful SQL injection attack could also cause denial of service by overwhelming the database or causing it to crash due to malicious queries. Additionally, resource exhaustion or database corruption resulting from malicious input could degrade system performance or make the password reset functionality unavailable, thereby impacting the availability of the affected component."
