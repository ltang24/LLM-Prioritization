No physical or local access is required. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | Low (L) | Exploiting the flaw only requires sending specially crafted recursive data. No special conditions or environmental factors are needed. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | None (N) | The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any privileges on the target system. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | None (N) | The vulnerability is triggered automatically when the application parses malicious data—no user action is required. |\n| **Scope (S)** | Unchanged (U) | The impact is confined to the vulnerable component itself. There is no indication that other components are affected. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)** | None (N) | The vulnerability does not expose or compromise sensitive data. |\n| **Integrity (I)** | None (N) | There is no alteration of data or unauthorized modification involved. |\n| **Availability (A)** | Low (L) | The application crashes with a `RecursionError`, causing a denial of service. However, it does not permanently disable the system or require a reboot, so the impact is considered low. |\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can also walk you through how this compares to CVSS v4.0 or help you calculate Temporal and Environmental scores.

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted Protocol Buffers data to the application that processes untrusted input. Since the attack involves external data input over a network or other communication channel, an attacker does not need local access or physical proximity. The attacker’s ability to trigger the issue depends solely on their capacity to deliver malicious data to the vulnerable component, making the exploitation feasible without local or physical access."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to craft Protocol Buffers data that contains deeply recursive structures, such as recursive groups or messages with numerous nested SGROUP tags. Achieving this involves understanding the data format and constructing specific payloads, but does not depend on complex environmental conditions or multiple prerequisite configurations. The primary challenge lies in generating the malicious input, which is a technical task but does not involve additional system states or intricate setup beyond the data crafting itself."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any prior access or elevated permissions on the target system to exploit this vulnerability. The malicious data can be sent through standard interfaces or communication channels that the application exposes, and no special user privileges are necessary to initiate the attack. The attacker’s role is limited to delivering the crafted input, with no requirement for existing credentials or system-level privileges."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not depend on any human user participating beyond the attacker themselves. The attacker can initiate the attack independently by sending malicious data without prompting or involving other users. The vulnerability is triggered purely by the application processing the specially crafted input, and no additional user actions or interactions are required for the attack to succeed."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability described in CVE-2025-4565 is confined to the component parsing untrusted Protocol Buffers data using the Protobuf Pure-Python backend. The issue arises due to uncontrolled recursion depth, leading to a crash within the same component's execution context. There is no indication that the vulnerability allows an attacker to affect other components or cross defined security boundaries. Therefore, the scope remains unchanged, as the impact is limited to the vulnerable component itself and does not propagate to other parts of the system or external components"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "This vulnerability does not involve unauthorized access to or disclosure of sensitive information. The attack vector is based on causing a RecursionError through deeply nested or recursive Protocol Buffers data, which results in a crash. There is no evidence or mechanism described that would allow an attacker to read or exfiltrate data from memory or storage. As such, the confidentiality of the system's data remains unaffected by this vulnerability"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "There is no indication that this vulnerability allows an attacker to modify, delete, or corrupt data. The issue strictly results in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition due to a RecursionError triggered by maliciously crafted input. The vulnerability does not provide the attacker with write access to memory or storage, nor does it allow tampering with the integrity of the data processed by the application. Therefore, the integrity impact is considered none"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability directly affects the availability of the application using the Protobuf Pure-Python backend. By sending specially crafted Protocol Buffers data with excessive recursion, an attacker can reliably trigger a RecursionError, causing the application to crash. This results in a complete denial of service for the affected component, potentially requiring manual intervention or restart. The attack is low-complexity and does not require authentication, making it a significant threat to service availability"
