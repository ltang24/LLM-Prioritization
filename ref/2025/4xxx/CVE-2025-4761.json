      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible PHP file, specifically /admin/admin-profile.php, and is triggered by manipulating the 'mobilenumber' parameter. Since the attack can be initiated remotely, an attacker does not need physical access or proximity to the target system. Exploitation can occur over standard internet protocols, such as HTTP, allowing attackers to send crafted requests from any location with network connectivity. This broad accessibility significantly increases the exposure of the vulnerable component to external threats"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation method involves SQL injection through a user-supplied parameter, which typically requires no special environmental conditions beyond the application accepting and processing the input without proper sanitization. There is no indication of required authentication bypass, race conditions, or specific timing constraints. The attacker only needs to identify the vulnerable endpoint and craft a malicious input string. Therefore, the conditions necessary for exploitation are straightforward and do not depend on unpredictable or external factors"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerable endpoint is located within the administrative section of the application, suggesting that access may be restricted to authenticated users with elevated permissions. However, the CVE description does not specify whether authentication is enforced before reaching the vulnerable code. If the endpoint is exposed without access control, exploitation could occur without any prior authentication. If access control is present, the attacker would need to possess credentials with sufficient privileges to reach and manipulate the 'mobilenumber' parameter"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attack vector involves direct manipulation of a request parameter, which can be executed entirely by the attacker through automated tools or manual input. There is no indication that a legitimate user must perform any action, such as clicking a link, opening a file, or interacting with the application in a specific way. The compromise occurs solely through the attacker's crafted input, meaning no additional user involvement is necessary for successful exploitation"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides within the /admin/admin-profile.php component of the PHPGurukul Complaint Management System 2.0. Since the SQL injection affects an administrative interface and could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, it may impact other database components or system resources beyond the immediate scope. If exploited, it could lead to unauthorized access or control over the broader system, crossing security boundaries and affecting resources outside the initial component."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The SQL injection vulnerability could enable an attacker to access sensitive data stored within the database, such as user information, complaint details, or administrative credentials. Exploiting the flaw might lead to data disclosure, compromising confidentiality by exposing private or protected information managed by the system, especially if the attacker can extract or retrieve data through manipulated queries."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker could modify or corrupt data within the database, such as updating user profiles, complaint records, or administrative settings. This could undermine data integrity, leading to inaccurate or maliciously altered information, which may affect system trustworthiness and operational correctness."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While the primary concern is data manipulation, SQL injection can also be leveraged to cause denial-of-service conditions by executing resource-intensive queries or deleting critical data. Such actions could disrupt normal system operations, degrade performance, or render the complaint management system temporarily unavailable, impacting service availability."
