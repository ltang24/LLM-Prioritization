        "content": "Sure! Here's a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4430**, based on the official definitions and the vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### üîç CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Analysis for CVE-2025-4430\n\n**Vulnerability Summary**  \nEZD RP versions prior to 20.19 allow unauthorized access to the `/api/Token/gettoken` endpoint, enabling file manipulation. The root cause is **Missing Authorization (CWE-862)**.\n\n---\n\n#### üì° Attack Vector (AV): **Network (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerable endpoint is exposed via an API (`/api/Token/gettoken`), which implies remote access over a network.\n- **Impact**: An attacker does not need physical or local access; exploitation can occur over the internet or internal network.\n\n---\n\n#### ‚öôÔ∏è Attack Complexity (AC): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: No indication of special conditions or environmental factors required. The vulnerability stems from a lack of authorization checks, which typically means exploitation is straightforward.\n- **Impact**: The attacker doesn‚Äôt need to bypass any complex defenses or perform reconnaissance.\n\n---\n\n#### üîê Privileges Required (PR): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The description specifies **unauthorized access**, meaning the attacker does not need valid credentials or any prior access.\n- **Impact**: This significantly increases the severity, as anyone can exploit it.\n\n---\n\n#### üë§ User Interaction (UI): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker interacts directly with the API endpoint; no user involvement (e.g., clicking links or opening files) is required.\n- **Impact**: Fully autonomous exploitation.\n\n---\n\n#### üß≠ Scope (S): **Unchanged (U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerable component (EZD RP) and the impacted component (file manipulation within EZD RP) are the same. There‚Äôs no indication that exploitation affects other systems or privileges outside the vulnerable component.\n- **Impact**: The impact is contained within the same security authority.\n\n---\n\n#### üîê Confidentiality Impact (C): **High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: File manipulation via unauthorized token access could expose sensitive data or allow access to protected resources.\n- **Impact**: Significant data exposure is possible.\n\n---\n\n#### üßæ Integrity Impact (I): **High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: The ability to manipulate files implies the attacker can alter or inject unauthorized content.\n- **Impact**: Trust in system data can be compromised.\n\n---\n\n#### ‚ö° Availability Impact (A): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: There's no mention of denial-of-service or system disruption. The vulnerability appears to affect access and modification, not availability.\n- **Impact**: System remains operational.\n\n---\n\n### üßÆ CVSS v3.1 Vector String\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n```\n\n### üìä Estimated Base Score: **8.6 (High)**  \nThis score reflects a serious vulnerability due to remote, unauthenticated exploitation with high impact on confidentiality and integrity.\n\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like to explore Temporal or Environmental metrics next, or need help modeling this in a risk report.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability involves unauthorized access to a web API endpoint ('/api/Token/gettoken'), which implies that exploitation can occur over a networked environment. An attacker does not need physical proximity to the target system and can initiate the attack remotely, provided they can reach the exposed endpoint. This setup typically allows exploitation from any location with internet access, assuming the endpoint is publicly accessible or reachable through some exposed interface"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "There are no indications of special configurations, timing requirements, or environmental conditions that must be met for exploitation. The vulnerability appears to stem from a missing authorization check, which means that any request to the endpoint may be processed without validation. This suggests that exploitation is straightforward and does not depend on unpredictable factors or external system states beyond the attacker‚Äôs control"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The description specifies 'unauthorized access,' which indicates that the attacker does not need to authenticate or possess any prior access rights to the system. The endpoint responds to unauthenticated requests, allowing file manipulation without requiring the attacker to hold any user or administrative privileges beforehand. This significantly lowers the barrier to exploitation and broadens the pool of potential attackers"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "There is no mention of any user involvement in the exploitation process. The vulnerability allows direct access to a backend API endpoint, which typically does not require a user to click links, open files, or perform any action. The attacker can exploit the flaw independently, without relying on social engineering or user-triggered events to succeed"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in EZD RP affects the '/api/Token/gettoken' endpoint, which is responsible for authentication token generation. Unauthorized access to this endpoint implies that attackers can manipulate files beyond the intended security boundaries of the authentication component. Since token generation typically governs access across multiple modules, exploitation could allow privilege escalation or unauthorized access to other parts of the system, thereby crossing component boundaries and impacting resources outside the original scope"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "Unauthorized access to the token generation endpoint poses a significant threat to confidentiality. Tokens often encapsulate user credentials or session identifiers, and if an attacker can retrieve or forge them, they may gain access to sensitive data across the application. This could include user profiles, internal documents, or configuration files, depending on the privileges associated with the compromised token. The ability to manipulate files further amplifies the risk of data exposure"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The file manipulation capability enabled by this vulnerability directly threatens the integrity of the system. Attackers could alter configuration files, inject malicious code, or tamper with logs and audit trails. Such modifications could compromise the accuracy and trustworthiness of system data, mislead administrators, or even disable security mechanisms. The fact that this occurs through an authentication endpoint suggests that integrity violations could be systemic and difficult to detect"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While the vulnerability primarily targets authentication and file manipulation, its impact on availability cannot be dismissed. Malicious file operations could corrupt essential system files or overload the server with unauthorized requests, leading to performance degradation or denial of service. If attackers modify startup configurations or delete critical resources, the EZD RP service may become unstable or entirely unavailable to legitimate users"
