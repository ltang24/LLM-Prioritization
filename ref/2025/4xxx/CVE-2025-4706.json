      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to initiate exploitation over a network connection without requiring physical access or proximity. Since the attack can be performed remotely via standard web requests to the affected system, the attacker does not need to be on the same local network or have physical access to the server hosting the application. This means that the attack can be carried out from anywhere with internet connectivity, making remote exploitation feasible without any prior access to the target environment."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability involves manipulating input parameters that are processed by the server-side script. The attacker must craft a specific input payload that triggers the SQL injection, which requires understanding of the application's input handling and possibly some trial and error. However, there are no indications of additional special conditions, configurations, or complex steps needed beyond standard input manipulation. The attacker does not need to bypass multiple layers of security or perform elaborate setup, as the vulnerability exists in the normal processing of user-supplied data, making the exploitation straightforward once the attack vector is identified."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker does not need any existing privileges on the target system. The attack leverages the application's handling of user input, which is accessible to any user who can send requests to the web interface. Since the attacker can perform the attack remotely and without authentication, they do not require any prior credentials or elevated permissions. The attack can be executed by an unauthenticated user who simply interacts with the vulnerable web page, making the privilege requirement minimal or nonexistent."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not depend on the participation or actions of any other human user besides the attacker. The attacker can initiate the attack by sending specially crafted requests directly to the web application, without needing any assistance or interaction from other users. There is no requirement for a legitimate user to perform specific actions, nor does the attack depend on social engineering or user-triggered events. The attacker’s own interaction with the system suffices to carry out the exploit successfully."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The SQL injection vulnerability occurs within a specific component (/Procedure3b_yearwiseVisit.php), which directly processes user input. Since the compromised component interacts with a backend database, successful exploitation can potentially affect data storage systems and other modules that rely on database integrity, thereby crossing the initial security scope of the affected script. Thus, exploitation of this vulnerability may cause systemic impact beyond the immediate vulnerable endpoint, suggesting a change in scope"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "By manipulating the Visit_year parameter, attackers can inject malicious SQL queries that access confidential data stored in the database. This may include personally identifiable information (PII) about users, examination records, and authentication credentials. Since the vulnerability is remotely exploitable and publicly disclosed, attackers can retrieve protected information without authorization, leading to a high impact on confidentiality"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection vulnerabilities do not just read data—they can also alter it. An attacker exploiting this flaw could insert, update, or delete records in the backend database, compromising the integrity of examination results, user records, or system configurations. This tampering undermines trust in the system and may disrupt critical workflows, reflecting a significant integrity impact"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Although the primary vector of this vulnerability is SQL injection, it can affect availability if leveraged to perform operations like dropping tables, executing expensive queries that overload the server, or locking essential database resources. These actions can cause system downtime, degrade performance, or consume critical server resources, representing a moderate to high impact on availability depending on the exploit payload"
