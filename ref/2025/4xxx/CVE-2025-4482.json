      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible PHP script, specifically within the password recovery functionality. Exploitation involves injecting malicious SQL code into a parameter that is processed server-side. Since the attack can be initiated by sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected endpoint, the attacker does not need physical access or proximity to the system. This means the exploit can be executed from any location with internet connectivity, making the attack feasible from a highly remote context"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not appear to rely on any unusual environmental conditions or specific system configurations. The vulnerable parameter is directly injectable, and the exploit has already been publicly disclosed, suggesting that the attack path is straightforward. There is no indication of required authentication tokens, session states, or race conditions that would complicate exploitation. Therefore, the attacker does not need to manipulate or anticipate any external factors beyond crafting a malicious input"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerability affects a publicly accessible script used for password recovery, which typically does not require prior authentication. The attacker can interact with the vulnerable endpoint without needing to log in or possess any user credentials. This implies that the attacker does not need to hold any level of access or authorization within the system before launching the attack, allowing exploitation from a completely unauthenticated state"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attack targets a backend script and is triggered by sending a malicious request directly to the server. There is no indication that a legitimate user must perform any action, such as clicking a link, opening a file, or interacting with the application, for the exploit to succeed. The attacker can execute the payload independently, without relying on any user behavior or cooperation, making the compromise fully automated from the attacker's side"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a specific PHP file within the Student Project Allocation System and is triggered via SQL injection. However, the exploit does not appear to affect components outside the vulnerable application. The attack manipulates input parameters to execute unauthorized SQL commands within the same database context, without crossing into other systems or security domains. Therefore, the impact remains confined to the vulnerable component’s security scope, indicating an 'Unchanged' scope under CVSS v3.1"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The SQL injection flaw allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to potentially extract sensitive data from the backend database. This may include student records, project allocations, or user credentials. Since the attacker can bypass authentication and directly query the database, the confidentiality of stored information is compromised. However, the impact is limited to the data managed by the vulnerable component, suggesting a 'Low' confidentiality impact under CVSS v3.1"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability enables the attacker to modify or delete database records. This could corrupt project assignments, alter student details, or inject malicious data into the system. Such unauthorized changes undermine the trustworthiness of the application’s data and its operational integrity. Given the potential for targeted data manipulation, the integrity impact is considered 'Low' under CVSS v3.1, as the scope of corruption is limited to the affected component"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While the vulnerability does not directly cause denial of service, SQL injection attacks can be crafted to consume database resources or crash the application by executing expensive queries. This may lead to performance degradation or temporary unavailability of the Student Project Allocation System. However, there is no indication of persistent service disruption or system-wide outages, so the availability impact is rated as 'Low' under CVSS v3.1"
