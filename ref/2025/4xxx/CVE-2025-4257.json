        "content": "Here’s a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4257**, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SeaCMS 13.2 affecting `/admin_pay.php` via the `cstatus` parameter [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4257) [[1]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4257):\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Attack Vector (AV): **Network (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, as stated in the description. XSS typically occurs through crafted URLs or HTTP requests sent over the network.\n- **Impact**: No physical or local access is needed; the attacker can exploit it over the internet.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ Attack Complexity (AC): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: No special conditions or environmental factors are required. The attacker simply manipulates a parameter (`cstatus`) to inject malicious script.\n- **Impact**: Straightforward exploitation without needing to bypass any complex defenses.\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 Privileges Required (PR): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerable endpoint is `/admin_pay.php`, which suggests some level of access may be needed—likely authenticated but not highly privileged.\n- **Impact**: The attacker must have basic access, such as a logged-in user role, but not administrative rights.\n\n---\n\n### 👤 User Interaction (UI): **Required (R)**\n- **Reasoning**: XSS requires a victim to interact with the malicious payload—typically by clicking a link or loading a page.\n- **Impact**: The exploit only succeeds if a user triggers the injected script.\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 Scope (S): **Unchanged (U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The XSS affects the same security scope—the vulnerable web application. It doesn’t cross boundaries into other systems or components.\n- **Impact**: The impact is contained within the SeaCMS application.\n\n---\n\n### 🔒 Confidentiality Impact (C): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: XSS does not directly expose sensitive data unless chained with other vulnerabilities. No evidence suggests data leakage here.\n- **Impact**: No compromise of confidentiality.\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 Integrity Impact (I): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: XSS can allow attackers to modify how content is displayed or inject misleading information, affecting data integrity from the user’s perspective.\n- **Impact**: Limited impact on trustworthiness of displayed content.\n\n---\n\n### 🚫 Availability Impact (A): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: XSS does not affect system uptime or resource availability.\n- **Impact**: No disruption to service.\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 Final CVSS v3.1 Vector and Score\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N\nBase Score: 3.5 (Low)\n```\nThis score reflects a low-severity vulnerability that requires user interaction and limited privileges, with minimal impact on system integrity and no impact on confidentiality or availability [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4257) [[1]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4257).\n\nLet me know if you’d like to compare this with CVSS v4.0 or explore mitigation strategies.\n\n\n\n> [0] [NVD - CVE-2025-4257](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4257)\n>\n> [1] [CVE-2025-4257 - Vulnerability Details - OpenCVE](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4257)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The exploitation targets the /admin_pay.php endpoint and involves manipulating the cstatus parameter to trigger a cross-site scripting condition. Given that the attack can be initiated without physical or local access to the vulnerable system and is described as remotely executable, the exploitation context indicates that the attacker can engage with the system over a general-purpose communication channel such as the internet, using crafted HTTP requests to deliver the payload. This suggests no proximity constraints between the attacker and target system."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The vulnerability arises from improper input sanitization related to the cstatus parameter within a specific PHP script. This implies that the attacker does not need to rely on any unusual system states, specialized software environments, or administrator-enabled settings. The absence of mention of required external services, time-sensitive actions, or application state dependencies further supports the interpretation that no exceptional conditions are necessary beyond the target running the vulnerable version of SeaCMS."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "Based on the location of the vulnerable script—/admin_pay.php—it could be assumed that administrative authentication might normally be required to access this endpoint. However, the public disclosure and description suggest that the vulnerability may be exploitable without prior authentication. If the parameter can be manipulated through unauthenticated interaction, the attacker would not need to obtain elevated system privileges beforehand. No indication is given that login credentials or any user-level access are prerequisites for initiating the exploit."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities typically rely on a target user executing malicious content unwittingly—usually by visiting a URL containing embedded malicious script or interacting with compromised interface elements. Therefore, successful exploitation generally demands some form of user participation, such as clicking a link or loading a manipulated webpage. The vulnerability description aligns with this pattern, implying that the attacker’s payload must be rendered or interpreted by a human user’s browser session for compromise to occur."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The scope of this vulnerability is confined to the web application component where the cross-site scripting (XSS) occurs. The XSS vulnerability in /admin_pay.php does not inherently affect other components or systems beyond the web application itself. Therefore, the impact remains within the security scope of the SeaCMS application, without crossing into other security boundaries or affecting external resources"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The confidentiality impact of this XSS vulnerability is significant because an attacker could potentially steal session cookies, login credentials, or other sensitive information from users who interact with the compromised component. By injecting malicious scripts, the attacker can access data that is meant to be confidential, thereby compromising the integrity of user information"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The integrity impact is notable because an attacker can manipulate the content displayed to users by injecting malicious scripts. This could lead to users being presented with altered information, or the attacker could perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent. However, the underlying data stored in the database is not directly modified by this type of XSS attack"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The availability impact of this XSS vulnerability is generally low. While the attack can disrupt the user experience by injecting unwanted scripts, it does not directly cause a denial of service or degrade the performance of the SeaCMS application. The primary impact is on the user interface and interaction, rather than the availability of the service itself"
