        "content": "Here’s a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metric analysis for **CVE-2025-4537**, based on the official definitions and the vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Attack Vector (AV): **Network (AV:N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as stated in the description. This implies that the attacker does not need physical or local access and can initiate the attack over a network (e.g., via HTTP requests).\n- **Impact**: This is the most severe AV rating, as it allows exploitation from anywhere.\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 Attack Complexity (AC): **High (AC:H)**\n- **Reasoning**: The description notes that the attack complexity is “rather high” and exploitation is “known to be difficult.” This suggests that successful exploitation requires specific conditions or knowledge beyond the attacker’s control, such as understanding the application’s internal logic or crafting precise payloads.\n- **Impact**: Reduces the overall score due to the difficulty in executing the attack.\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 Privileges Required (PR): **None (PR:N)**\n- **Reasoning**: There’s no indication that the attacker needs to be authenticated or have any privileges to exploit the vulnerability. If sensitive information is stored in cookies and accessible via client-side manipulation, it likely requires no prior access.\n- **Impact**: Increases severity, as anyone can attempt the exploit.\n\n---\n\n### 👤 User Interaction (UI): **Required (UI:R)**\n- **Reasoning**: Since the vulnerability involves cookies and login components, it likely requires a user to log in or perform some action that triggers the vulnerable behavior. This implies that exploitation depends on user participation.\n- **Impact**: Slightly lowers the score due to reliance on user behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 Scope (S): **Unchanged (S:U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability affects the confidentiality of data within the same security scope (i.e., the web application itself). There’s no indication that it impacts other components or systems outside its boundary.\n- **Impact**: Keeps the score within the same scope.\n\n---\n\n### 🕵️ Confidentiality Impact (C): **Low (C:L)**\n- **Reasoning**: Sensitive information is stored in cleartext in cookies, which could be accessed by attackers. However, the impact is limited to exposure of credentials or session data, not full system compromise.\n- **Impact**: Indicates partial loss of confidentiality.\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 Integrity Impact (I): **None (I:N)**\n- **Reasoning**: There’s no mention of data being modified or tampered with. The vulnerability is purely about information disclosure.\n- **Impact**: No effect on data integrity.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ Availability Impact (A): **None (A:N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability does not affect system availability or cause denial of service.\n- **Impact**: No impact on availability.\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 CVSS Vector String\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N\n```\n\n### 📊 Estimated Base Score: **3.7 (Low)**\n- Based on the metrics above, this vulnerability is considered **Low severity** under CVSS v3.1 [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4537).\n\nLet me know if you’d like help comparing this to CVSS v4.0 or exploring mitigation strategies.\n\n\n\n> [0] [CVE-2025-4537 - NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4537)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability involves the storage of sensitive information in cleartext within a cookie, which is accessible through client-side mechanisms. Since cookies are transmitted with HTTP requests, an attacker does not need physical access to the system or to be on the same local network. Instead, they can exploit this issue from a remote location by intercepting traffic or tricking the victim into visiting a malicious site. The fact that the attack can be initiated without proximity to the target system indicates that the attacker can operate from a distant or external environment, such as over the internet"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability requires conditions that are not entirely under the attacker’s control. For example, the attacker must rely on the application to improperly store sensitive data in cookies, which may depend on specific configurations or versions of the RuoYi-Vue framework. Additionally, successful exploitation may require the attacker to bypass browser security mechanisms or network protections such as HTTPS, which encrypts cookie data in transit. These dependencies introduce variability and increase the difficulty of reliably executing the attack across different environments"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerability targets the login and encryption components of the application, specifically affecting how passwords are handled and stored. Since the issue involves client-side files and cookie manipulation, an attacker does not need elevated access to the server or administrative control over the application. They can potentially exploit the flaw without authenticating or logging into the system, assuming they can observe or manipulate the cookie data. This suggests that the attacker does not need to possess any special permissions or roles within the application to initiate the attack"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may need the victim to perform an action such as logging into the application or visiting a specific page that triggers the flawed password handling logic. This interaction causes the sensitive data to be stored in a cookie, which the attacker can then attempt to access or intercept. Without the victim initiating this behavior, the exploit may not be feasible, indicating that the success of the attack depends on the participation of a human user who is not the attacker"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability impacts the Password Handler component, specifically the storage of sensitive information in a cookie. Since cookies are shared across client-server boundaries, exploitation could extend beyond the immediate component, potentially affecting other systems or components that rely on the compromised credentials. This indicates a change in scope as the vulnerability crosses security boundaries"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The cleartext storage of sensitive information, such as passwords or session tokens, in a cookie directly compromises confidentiality. An attacker who intercepts or accesses the cookie can obtain sensitive data, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts or systems. This poses a significant risk to information confidentiality"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "While the vulnerability primarily affects confidentiality, it could indirectly impact integrity if an attacker uses the compromised credentials to modify data or configurations within the affected system. However, the vulnerability itself does not directly enable data corruption or unauthorized modifications"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability does not inherently disrupt the availability of the affected component or system. There is no indication that exploitation would lead to service downtime, performance degradation, or resource exhaustion, making the availability impact negligible"
