This vulnerability involves a **SQL Injection** in PHPGurukul Online Course Registration 3.1 via the `coursecode` parameter in `/admin/course.php`.\n\n---\n\n### ‚öôÔ∏è CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Evaluation\n\n| **Metric**             | **Value**      | **Reasoning** |\n|------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)** | **Network (N)** | Exploitation can be done remotely over the internet, without physical or local access‚Äîsuggesting a network-based attack.         |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)**    | The vulnerability involves direct injection through a parameter; no specific conditions or unusual configurations are required.  |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None (N)** | The attacker doesn‚Äôt need to be authenticated‚Äîsince the parameter is accessible publicly.                                        |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)**   | No human interaction is needed beyond the attacker; the attack can be automated or scripted.                                     |\n| **Scope (S)**          | **Unchanged (U)** | The impact is likely confined to the vulnerable component (web application/backend database) and does not affect other systems. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)**| **High (H)**    | SQL injection can lead to data exfiltration or viewing unauthorized records, posing a serious confidentiality risk.              |\n| **Integrity (I)**      | **High (H)**    | Attackers may modify or corrupt data within the database, such as course records or user profiles.                               |\n| **Availability (A)**   | **High (H)**    | SQL injection could allow deletion of records or disruption of queries, impacting service availability or uptime.                |\n\n---\n\n### üìä Resulting CVSS v3.1 Base Score (Estimated)\n**Score: 9.8 (Critical)**  \nThis is consistent with the CVE‚Äôs classification. The combination of **remote exploitability**, **no privileges**, and **high impact** across C/I/A makes it extremely dangerous.\n\n---\n\nWant to break this down visually or generate a CVSS vector string from it?

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible PHP file, specifically /admin/course.php, and involves improper handling of the coursecode parameter, which permits SQL injection. Since exploitation involves remotely sending manipulated HTTP requests to a publicly reachable endpoint, an attacker does not need to be physically proximate or have direct access to the host machine. The vulnerable interface is exposed over the internet, enabling exploitation from any location with network connectivity to the target application"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Successful exploitation hinges on injecting crafted SQL commands into a specific HTTP parameter without requiring any prior environmental setup, race conditions, or complex prerequisites. The vulnerable endpoint does not appear to enforce input sanitization, and SQL injection is a well-understood technique for attackers. There are no indications of necessary system misconfigurations or dependencies beyond typical web application behavior, making the path to exploit straightforward under standard deployment scenarios"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerable code is reachable via direct HTTP request and does not appear to enforce any access control or authentication checks to access or interact with the /admin/course.php endpoint. Given that SQL injection typically occurs upon submission of data to a poorly validated parameter, attackers can initiate the exploit from the perspective of an external, unauthenticated actor without needing session credentials or elevated access levels within the system"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploit can be initiated solely through automated HTTP traffic and crafted input sent to the affected parameter. Since the vector involves server-side manipulation via SQL injection, there is no reliance on user behavior such as clicking links, downloading files, or executing actions that facilitate compromise. The attacker can independently trigger the vulnerability without requiring any cooperative action from a legitimate user of the application"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The SQL injection vulnerability affects the /admin/course.php component within the PHPGurukul Online Course Registration 3.1 system. Because the injection occurs via the 'coursecode' parameter, which likely interacts with a backend database, exploitation may influence other security domains such as the database engine and connected subsystems. This creates a change in scope, as it enables the attacker to interact with data and operations outside the immediate context of the vulnerable component"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "Successful exploitation of the SQL injection flaw could grant unauthorized access to the course registration system's database. This may expose sensitive records such as user credentials, personal identifiable information (PII), course enrollment details, or administrative metadata. An attacker could craft malicious queries to retrieve or enumerate confidential fields, thereby compromising the confidentiality of the entire backend datastore managed by the component"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "This vulnerability allows for direct manipulation of SQL statements, posing a significant risk to the integrity of the system's data. An attacker may execute unauthorized UPDATE or DELETE queries, modifying course codes, altering student records, or even injecting fraudulent data into the database. Such tampering can lead to systemic errors, data corruption, and degradation of trust in the application‚Äôs outputs and reports"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While SQL injection primarily compromises confidentiality and integrity, its impact on availability should not be overlooked. Exploitation may result in execution of resource-intensive queries or insertion of commands that lock or disable database tables, leading to performance degradation or downtime. Furthermore, if used to delete essential records or crash the service through malformed statements, it could result in partial or total service denial"
