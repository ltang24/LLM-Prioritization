      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible PHP file within the administrative interface of the application. Exploitation involves manipulating a query parameter ('searchdata') via HTTP requests, which can be crafted and sent from any system connected to the internet. This means the attacker does not need physical access or proximity to the target system and can initiate the attack from a completely separate network or geographic location. The exposure of the vulnerable endpoint over the web significantly broadens the attack surface, allowing exploitation from virtually anywhere"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploit involves injecting malicious SQL code into a query parameter without requiring any special environmental conditions. There is no indication that the attacker must bypass additional security mechanisms, perform timing-based attacks, or rely on race conditions. The vulnerability appears to be directly exploitable as long as the application is deployed with the affected script accessible and the input is not properly sanitized. This suggests that the conditions necessary for exploitation are minimal and do not depend on unpredictable or external factors beyond the attacker’s control"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerable endpoint is located within the administrative section of the application, but the exploit targets a publicly accessible parameter. There is no mention of authentication or session requirements to reach the vulnerable code, implying that the attacker can interact with the endpoint without first gaining access to an account or elevated permissions. This means the attacker does not need to be logged in or possess any specific role within the system to execute the SQL injection, making the attack feasible without prior compromise or privilege escalation"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request with malicious input to a server-side script. There is no indication that a legitimate user must click a link, open a file, or perform any action to trigger the vulnerability. The server processes the input autonomously, and the SQL injection occurs entirely on the backend. Therefore, the success of the exploit does not depend on any user behavior or interaction, and the attacker can execute the attack independently without relying on social engineering or user cooperation"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The SQL injection vulnerability in /admin/request-received-bydonar.php allows attackers to manipulate backend database queries via the searchdata parameter. Since this component interfaces directly with database resources, successful exploitation may impact the integrity or confidentiality of database records, which are outside the immediate security scope of the vulnerable web interface. This represents a scope change because the database is a separate security authority and is impacted as a consequence of flaws in the application layer"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection vulnerabilities often enable attackers to extract arbitrary data from the backend database. In the context of a blood bank system, this may include personally identifiable information (PII) of donors, blood type records, and sensitive medical data. The vulnerability can be remotely exploited without prior authentication, meaning unauthorized data access is a significant risk. If exploited, it could result in full read access to stored data, severely compromising confidentiality"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "An attacker exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability could not only read data but potentially execute SQL statements that alter or delete records. This can corrupt donor records, modify blood inventory data, or inject malicious values into the database. Since the application likely uses dynamic SQL queries, the lack of input validation could permit data tampering. Such unauthorized modification poses a serious threat to the trustworthiness and accuracy of the system’s data"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Depending on the crafted SQL payload, an attacker could execute commands that disrupt database operations. For example, issuing long-running queries, dropping critical tables, or locking database rows could degrade performance or render the system unusable. These actions may lead to denial of service for legitimate users, particularly during emergency blood requests. Therefore, availability of the system could be significantly impacted through resource exhaustion or data structure destruction"
