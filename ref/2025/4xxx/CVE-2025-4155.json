      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to initiate exploitation over a network without requiring physical access or proximity. Since the attack can be performed remotely via manipulation of input parameters over the internet, the attacker does not need to be on the same local network or physically interact with the system. This broad accessibility means the attacker can exploit the flaw from any location that can reach the application's interface, making remote network access the primary context for exploitation."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability involves sending specially crafted input to the application, specifically manipulating the 'bid' parameter in the affected script. The attacker does not need to bypass complex authentication or evade multiple security controls; the primary challenge is to craft an input that triggers the SQL injection. Since the attack relies on standard input manipulation without requiring specific timing, environmental conditions, or advanced techniques, the complexity is low. The attacker can perform the attack with straightforward tools, assuming they can reach the application endpoint."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must be able to send requests to the application's input interface where the 'bid' parameter is processed. Typically, this requires at least the ability to access the application's administrative or editing functions, which may be publicly accessible or require authentication. If the attacker can access the input point directly without prior authentication, then no privileges are needed beforehand. If access is restricted, then the attacker must have obtained or possess the necessary credentials or permissions to reach the vulnerable functionality. In the absence of such restrictions, the attacker can perform the attack without any prior privileges."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process involves the attacker directly sending malicious input to the application, which does not require any action or participation from other users. The attack is automated and can be executed without the involvement of a human user other than the attacker. No additional users need to perform actions, click links, or provide input; the attacker’s own interaction with the system suffices to trigger the vulnerability and achieve the malicious outcome."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The CVSS v3.1 Scope metric remains 'Unchanged' for CVE-2025-4155 because the SQL injection vulnerability affects only the vulnerable component—the PHPGurukul Boat Booking System's admin interface. Exploitation of the 'bid' parameter in /admin/edit-boat.php does not result in privilege escalation or impact other components outside the system’s defined security authority. The attack manipulates backend SQL queries but does not cross trust boundaries or affect external systems or services"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the backend database. This includes customer booking details, personal information, and potentially administrative credentials. Since the attacker can remotely exploit the flaw without prior authentication, the risk of data exposure is significant. However, the impact is rated 'Low' under CVSS v3.1 because the attacker’s access is limited to the scope of the vulnerable component and does not guarantee full data exfiltration"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection vulnerabilities inherently allow attackers to modify database content. In this case, the attacker could alter boat booking records, change user roles, or corrupt system configurations. Such unauthorized modifications compromise the trustworthiness of the data and could disrupt business operations. The CVSS v3.1 rating of 'Low' reflects that while data tampering is possible, it is confined to the vulnerable application and does not extend to broader system integrity violations"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "An attacker exploiting this SQL injection could craft queries that degrade performance or crash the database, such as using heavy joins or recursive queries. They might also delete critical records or lock tables, leading to partial service outages. However, the CVSS v3.1 rating of 'Low' suggests that while availability can be affected, the impact is not total system failure and recovery is feasible without extensive downtime"
