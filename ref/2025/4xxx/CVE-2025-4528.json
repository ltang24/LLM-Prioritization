        "content": "Here's a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4528**, based on the official definitions and available information [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4528):\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Attack Vector (AV): **Network (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, implying that the attacker does not need physical or local access. This places the attack vector in the **Network** category, which is the most remote and therefore the most severe.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ Attack Complexity (AC): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: There’s no indication of special conditions or environmental factors that must exist beyond the attacker’s control. The manipulation leads directly to session expiration, suggesting a straightforward exploit path.\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 Privileges Required (PR): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker must have some level of access to initiate the manipulation, but not full administrative control. Since the vulnerability affects session handling, it likely requires authenticated access but not elevated privileges.\n\n---\n\n### 👤 User Interaction (UI): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The description does not mention any need for user participation. The session expiration occurs due to manipulation initiated by the attacker, implying no user interaction is required.\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 Scope (S): **Unchanged (U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability affects session expiration within the same component. There’s no evidence that it impacts other components or crosses security boundaries, so the scope remains unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### 🕵️ Confidentiality Impact (C): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability leads to session expiration but does not expose sensitive data. Therefore, it does not compromise confidentiality.\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 Integrity Impact (I): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: Session expiration could disrupt expected behavior or cause premature termination of user actions, which may slightly affect data integrity (e.g., incomplete transactions or logs).\n\n---\n\n### 🚫 Availability Impact (A): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: Although sessions expire, the overall system remains available. There’s no indication of denial-of-service or resource exhaustion.\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 Final CVSS v3.1 Vector and Score\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N\nBase Score: 4.3 (Medium)\n```\n\nLet me know if you'd like to compare this with CVSS v4.0 or explore mitigation strategies.\n\n\n\n> [0] [CVE-2025-4528 - NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4528)",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring physical access to the device or proximity to a local system, as the attack can be initiated remotely over the network. This implies that an attacker can send crafted requests or manipulate network traffic from a distant location, leveraging the application's handling of sessions over the network interface. The attack does not depend on physical access or local user presence, making remote exploitation feasible through standard network communication channels."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability does not depend on complex or highly specific conditions beyond normal operational parameters. The attacker needs only to perform typical network-based actions, such as sending specially crafted requests or manipulating session-related data, which can be achieved with standard tools. There are no indications that the attacker must bypass intricate security controls or perform multiple steps requiring precise timing or environmental configurations, suggesting that the exploitation process is straightforward under normal network conditions."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any prior access privileges or authentication to initiate the attack. Since the vulnerability involves manipulating session states through network interactions, it can be exploited without any user credentials or elevated permissions. The attacker can operate from an unauthenticated position, relying solely on the ability to send malicious requests or data over the network interface that the application processes, thus requiring no privileges beforehand."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not necessitate any action or participation from legitimate users of the system. The attacker can perform all necessary steps remotely without prompting or involving other users, as the attack relies on sending malicious network traffic or requests that the application processes automatically. There is no requirement for a user to click links, open files, or perform any specific actions to trigger the vulnerability, making user interaction unnecessary for successful exploitation."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in Dígitro NGC Explorer up to version 3.44.15 appears to be limited to the component itself, as the primary effect is session expiration. This suggests that the vulnerability does not inherently affect other components or systems outside its security scope. Therefore, the scope is likely unchanged, as the issue does not cross security boundaries or impact resources beyond the affected component itself"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability description does not indicate any direct impact on the confidentiality of information. Since the primary effect is session expiration, it does not suggest unauthorized access to data or exposure of sensitive information. Thus, the confidentiality impact is likely minimal or none, as there is no indication that data could be accessed or disclosed due to this vulnerability"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability does not seem to affect the integrity of data, as the main consequence is session expiration. There is no indication that data can be modified, deleted, or corrupted as a result of exploiting this vulnerability. Therefore, the integrity impact is likely minimal or none, as the vulnerability does not appear to allow unauthorized data modification"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The primary impact of this vulnerability is session expiration, which can disrupt user access to the application. While this does not result in a complete denial of service, it can cause temporary unavailability for affected users. Therefore, the availability impact is notable, as it can lead to service disruption and require users to re-establish sessions, potentially affecting user experience and productivity"
