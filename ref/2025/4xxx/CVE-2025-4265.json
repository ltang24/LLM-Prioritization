        "content": "### CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Analysis for **CVE-2025-4265**\n\nThe vulnerability described is an SQL Injection in the `mobnum` parameter of the `/admin/contact-us.php` file in the PHPGurukul Emergency Ambulance Hiring Portal 1.0. Below is the detailed reasoning for each CVSS v3.1 base metric:\n\n---\n\n#### **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**\n- **Reasoning:**  \n  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network, as it involves manipulating an HTTP parameter (`mobnum`) in a web application endpoint (`/admin/contact-us.php`). No physical or local access is required.  \n  **Value:** **Network (N)**\n\n---\n\n#### **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning:**  \n  Exploiting this vulnerability does not require any special conditions or additional steps beyond sending a crafted HTTP request with malicious SQL payloads. There are no indications of mitigations like unpredictable inputs or race conditions.  \n  **Value:** **Low (L)**\n\n---\n\n#### **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**\n- **Reasoning:**  \n  The vulnerability is in a publicly accessible endpoint (`/admin/contact-us.php`), and the attacker does not need to authenticate or possess any privileges to exploit it.  \n  **Value:** **None (N)**\n\n---\n\n#### **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**\n- **Reasoning:**  \n  Exploitation does not require any user interaction, such as clicking a link or performing an action. The attacker can directly exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted request.  \n  **Value:** **None (N)**\n\n---\n\n#### **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**\n- **Reasoning:**  \n  The vulnerability affects the database backend of the same application, which is within the same security scope as the vulnerable web application. There is no indication that exploitation would affect other systems or components outside this scope.  \n  **Value:** **Unchanged (U)**\n\n---\n\n#### **Confidentiality Impact (C): High (H)**\n- **Reasoning:**  \n  SQL Injection vulnerabilities typically allow attackers to read sensitive data from the database, such as user information, credentials, or other confidential data. This represents a significant breach of confidentiality.  \n  **Value:** **High (H)**\n\n---\n\n#### **Integrity Impact (I): High (H)**\n- **Reasoning:**  \n  SQL Injection can allow attackers to modify or delete data in the database, compromising its integrity. For example, attackers could alter records, inject malicious data, or delete critical information.  \n  **Value:** **High (H)**\n\n---\n\n#### **Availability Impact (A): High (H)**\n- **Reasoning:**  \n  Exploitation of SQL Injection can lead to a denial of service by corrupting or deleting database records or by executing queries that overload the database, rendering the application unavailable.  \n  **Value:** **High (H)**\n\n---\n\n### **CVSS v3.1 Vector String and Score**\n\n#### **Vector String:**  \n`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`\n\n#### **Base Score:**  \n**9.8 (Critical)**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThis vulnerability is critical due to its remote exploitability, lack of required privileges or user interaction, and significant impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The SQL Injection in a publicly accessible endpoint poses a severe risk to the affected application and its database.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible script located at /admin/contact-us.php, and exploitation involves manipulating an HTTP parameter named 'mobnum'. Since the attack can be launched remotely, the attacker does not need physical access or proximity to the target system. Instead, they can send crafted requests over the internet to the vulnerable endpoint. This means the attacker can operate from any location with network connectivity, making the exploitation feasible from a broad range of remote environments without requiring direct access to the host system."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation of this vulnerability does not appear to depend on any unusual or unpredictable conditions. The attacker simply needs to inject malicious SQL syntax into the 'mobnum' parameter of a request to the vulnerable script. There is no indication that specific server configurations, timing conditions, or environmental factors must be present for the attack to succeed. The vulnerability is a straightforward SQL injection, which typically requires only knowledge of the application's input handling and database structure, both of which can be inferred or discovered through reconnaissance."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker is able to exploit the vulnerability by interacting with a publicly accessible script, suggesting that no prior authentication or elevated access is necessary. The manipulation of the 'mobnum' parameter implies that the attacker can send input directly to the application without needing to log in or possess any special permissions. This means the attacker can initiate the exploit as an unauthenticated user, targeting the application from the same level of access as any general visitor to the site."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is triggered through direct manipulation of a request parameter and does not require any action from a legitimate user of the system. The attacker can craft and send the malicious input independently, without relying on a user to click a link, open a file, or perform any other interaction. This indicates that the compromise is fully under the attacker’s control and does not depend on social engineering or user behavior to succeed."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in the /admin/contact-us.php endpoint of the Emergency Ambulance Hiring Portal and involves SQL injection via the 'mobnum' parameter. Since SQL injection can allow attackers to execute arbitrary queries on the backend database, the impact may extend beyond the immediate scope of the vulnerable web component. For example, unauthorized access or manipulation of data in other parts of the application or database could occur, affecting components not directly related to the contact form. This indicates a change in scope, as the compromise of one component (contact-us.php) can influence the security of other resources within the system"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection vulnerabilities often allow attackers to extract sensitive data from the backend database. In this case, the 'mobnum' parameter being injectable suggests that an attacker could craft queries to retrieve confidential user information such as contact details, medical records, or administrative credentials stored in the system. Given that the portal is related to emergency ambulance services, the database likely contains personally identifiable information (PII) and potentially sensitive health-related data. Therefore, the confidentiality impact is high due to the potential for unauthorized data disclosure"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection not only enables data retrieval but also allows modification or deletion of database records. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could alter user-submitted data, inject malicious content, or corrupt operational records such as ambulance dispatch logs or contact messages. This compromises the integrity of the system by allowing unauthorized changes to critical data, which could mislead administrators or disrupt service workflows. The potential for data tampering and corruption makes the integrity impact significant"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While SQL injection primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, it can also impact availability. An attacker could execute queries that lock tables, drop essential records, or overload the database with expensive operations, leading to performance degradation or denial of service. In a critical system like an ambulance hiring portal, such disruptions could delay emergency responses or render the service temporarily unusable. Therefore, the availability impact is notable, especially if the attack is automated or repeated"
