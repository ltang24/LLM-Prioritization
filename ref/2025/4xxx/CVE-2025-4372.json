        "content": "Here’s a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4372**, a **use-after-free vulnerability in WebAudio** in Google Chrome prior to version 136.0.7103.92:\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Attack Vector (AV): **Network (AV:N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability is exploitable via a **crafted HTML page**, which implies that an attacker can deliver the exploit remotely over the internet (e.g., through a malicious website).\n- **Definition match**: Network is appropriate when the vulnerable component is accessible remotely without physical or local access.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ Attack Complexity (AC): **Low (AC:L)**\n- **Reasoning**: No mention of special conditions or environmental factors that must be met for exploitation. Use-after-free vulnerabilities typically rely on memory mismanagement and are often reliably triggered with crafted input.\n- **Definition match**: Low complexity means no specific conditions beyond the attacker’s control are required.\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 Privileges Required (PR): **None (PR:N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any privileges in the browser or system to exploit the vulnerability—just deliver a crafted HTML page.\n- **Definition match**: “None” applies when no authentication or privileges are required.\n\n---\n\n### 👤 User Interaction (UI): **Required (UI:R)**\n- **Reasoning**: The victim must visit or interact with a malicious webpage, which constitutes user interaction.\n- **Definition match**: “Required” applies when exploitation depends on user actions like clicking a link or opening a file.\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 Scope (S): **Unchanged (S:U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability affects the WebAudio component within Chrome and does not appear to impact other components or systems beyond the browser’s sandbox.\n- **Definition match**: “Unchanged” means the exploited vulnerability does not propagate beyond its original security authority.\n\n---\n\n### 🔒 Confidentiality Impact (C): **High (C:H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Heap corruption from use-after-free can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing access to sensitive data.\n- **Definition match**: “High” applies when there is a total loss of confidentiality, such as full access to protected data.\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 Integrity Impact (I): **High (I:H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Arbitrary code execution could allow an attacker to modify browser behavior or data.\n- **Definition match**: “High” reflects a complete compromise of integrity, such as unauthorized modification of data.\n\n---\n\n### 🖥️ Availability Impact (A): **High (A:H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Exploiting heap corruption can crash the browser or system, leading to denial of service.\n- **Definition match**: “High” applies when the vulnerability causes a total loss of availability.\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 Final CVSS v3.1 Vector and Score\n**Vector String**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`  \n**Base Score**: **8.8 (High)** [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4372)\n\nThis score reflects a serious vulnerability that is remotely exploitable and can lead to full compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability—though it requires user interaction.\n\nWould you like help comparing this to similar CVEs or exploring mitigation strategies?\n\n\n\n> [0] [CVE-2025-4372 - NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4372)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability involves a flaw within the WebAudio component of the browser, which processes web content locally. Exploitation requires the attacker to craft a malicious webpage that, when visited by a user, triggers the vulnerability. Since the attack can be carried out through standard web browsing, the attacker does not need to access the target system directly or through specialized network channels, but instead relies on the user visiting a malicious site or clicking a malicious link. Therefore, the exploitation context is primarily remote, as the attacker can initiate the attack from anywhere on the internet without requiring physical proximity or local access."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability necessitates the attacker to craft a webpage with specific, carefully constructed HTML and JavaScript content that triggers the use-after-free condition within the WebAudio implementation. Achieving this requires understanding of the browser’s internal processing and memory management, as well as precise timing or specific sequences of actions within the webpage. These conditions are not inherently present in all web pages and depend on the attacker’s ability to engineer the exploit environment. No additional special configurations or unusual system states are typically needed beyond the attacker’s crafted webpage, but the attacker must have control over the content delivered to the victim’s browser, which involves some level of technical expertise and planning."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system prior to exploiting the vulnerability. The attack is initiated through a web page loaded in the victim’s browser, which runs with the user’s permissions. Since the attacker’s code executes within the context of the user’s browser session, there is no requirement for the attacker to have any prior access rights or elevated privileges on the system. The exploitation occurs purely through the victim’s interaction with the malicious webpage, leveraging the browser’s processing of web content without any additional privilege escalation steps."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "Successful exploitation depends on a user visiting a specially crafted webpage or clicking on a malicious link that contains the exploit code. The attacker cannot trigger the vulnerability solely through network traffic or passive means; instead, it requires the user to actively load or interact with the malicious content. This means that user participation is necessary for the attack to succeed, as the exploit relies on the victim’s browser executing the malicious script or webpage that contains the crafted payload. Without the user’s action to access the malicious webpage, the vulnerability cannot be exploited."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The CVE-2025-4372 vulnerability is confined to the WebAudio component within Google Chrome and does not cross security boundaries to affect other components or systems. The CVSS v3.1 vector string specifies Scope as Unchanged (S:U), indicating that exploitation does not result in a change to the security authority. The attacker’s actions remain within the bounds of the browser process, and while heap corruption may occur, it does not inherently impact other components outside Chrome’s sandboxed environment"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data processed by the browser. The CVSS vector assigns High Confidentiality Impact (C:H), suggesting that successful exploitation may result in the exposure of private user data such as audio streams, browsing activity, or other in-memory content. Since WebAudio handles media buffers, corrupted memory could be leveraged to read unintended data, violating confidentiality guarantees"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability’s classification as a use-after-free (CWE-416) implies that freed memory may be reused in unintended ways, allowing an attacker to inject or manipulate data structures. The CVSS vector indicates High Integrity Impact (I:H), meaning that exploitation could allow modification of browser state or execution of arbitrary code. This could corrupt the integrity of audio processing routines or other browser-managed data, leading to unauthorized changes in behavior or content"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Heap corruption resulting from use-after-free vulnerabilities can destabilize the browser, potentially causing crashes or denial of service. The CVSS vector assigns High Availability Impact (A:H), reflecting the possibility that exploitation could render the WebAudio component or the entire browser instance unusable. This would disrupt user access to services, degrade performance, or consume system resources excessively, thereby impacting availability significantly"
