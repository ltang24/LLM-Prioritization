        "content": "Here’s a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4671**, based on the official definitions and the vulnerability description [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4671):\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 CVSS v3.1 Vector: `AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N`\n**Base Score: 6.4 (Medium)**\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Metric Breakdown & Reasoning\n\n#### **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability is exploitable via WordPress pages using shortcodes, which are typically accessed over a network (e.g., via HTTP/S). No physical or local access is required.\n- **Value**: `AV:N`\n\n#### **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker only needs to inject malicious attributes into shortcodes. No special conditions or environmental factors are required beyond standard plugin usage.\n- **Value**: `AC:L`\n\n#### **Privileges Required (PR): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker must have contributor-level access or higher. This is considered “Low” privileges in CVSS, as it’s not administrative but still requires authentication.\n- **Value**: `PR:L`\n\n#### **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: Once the malicious shortcode is injected, the payload executes automatically when any user visits the affected page. No further interaction is needed from the victim.\n- **Value**: `UI:N`\n\n#### **Scope (S): Changed (C)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to affect other users and potentially the broader WordPress site by injecting scripts that execute in their browsers. This crosses the boundary of the vulnerable plugin’s scope.\n- **Value**: `S:C`\n\n#### **Confidentiality Impact (C): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: While the vulnerability could expose session data or other sensitive information via malicious scripts, it’s not guaranteed or systemic. Hence, the impact is rated as low.\n- **Value**: `C:L`\n\n#### **Integrity Impact (I): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker can modify content displayed to users (e.g., inject misleading or malicious scripts), but not the underlying data or system files.\n- **Value**: `I:L`\n\n#### **Availability Impact (A): None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability does not affect system availability. It doesn’t crash the site or prevent access.\n- **Value**: `A:N`\n\n---\n\nWould you like help calculating the Temporal or Environmental scores next? Or maybe a visual breakdown of the scoring logic?\n\n\n\n> [0] [NVD - CVE-2025-4671](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4671)",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker with the ability to authenticate to the WordPress site and access the plugin’s functionality to inject malicious scripts. Exploitation requires the attacker to log in with at least contributor privileges and utilize the plugin's features to insert malicious content. Since the attacker must be authenticated and have specific access rights, the attack is confined to interactions within the web application environment, rather than requiring remote or external access without authentication."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability necessitates that the attacker possesses valid credentials with sufficient privileges to access and modify plugin content, such as user meta or shortcode attributes. The attacker must understand the plugin’s input mechanisms and craft specific payloads that bypass insufficient sanitization. The conditions involve the attacker’s ability to log in and submit malicious data through standard plugin interfaces, which are typically straightforward but require knowledge of the plugin’s input points and the ability to craft appropriate payloads, making the exploitation not highly dependent on complex or unpredictable environmental factors."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have already gained at least contributor-level access or higher within the WordPress site. This level of access permits the attacker to create or modify content, including user meta and shortcode attributes, which are the vectors for injecting malicious scripts. Without such privileges, the attacker cannot access the plugin’s input fields or manipulate content in a way that leads to script injection, thus requiring prior authentication with a certain privilege level."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not require the participation or action of any users other than the attacker themselves. The attacker needs to log in and submit malicious input through the plugin’s interfaces; no additional user interactions, such as convincing a user to click a link or perform an action, are necessary. Once the malicious content is stored, it will execute when other users access the affected pages, but the attacker’s own interaction is limited to the initial injection phase, making user participation beyond the attacker unnecessary."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "This vulnerability involves Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Profile Builder plugin for WordPress, which allows attacker-controlled scripts to execute in the context of other users' browsers. Since the malicious script is stored and executed when another user accesses the affected page, the impact extends beyond the vulnerable component (the plugin) to the broader WordPress environment and potentially to the users’ browsers. This indicates a change in scope, as the attack crosses the boundary from server-side plugin code to client-side execution in another user’s browser, affecting resources outside the original security scope"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "Stored XSS can lead to significant confidentiality impacts because the injected script runs in the context of the victim's session. This can allow attackers to steal sensitive information such as session cookies, authentication tokens, or personal data displayed on the page. Since the attacker can craft the payload to exfiltrate data from the victim’s session, any confidential information accessible to the victim user is potentially at risk. The impact is particularly severe if the victim has administrative privileges or access to sensitive backend data"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The integrity of the application and user data is at risk because the attacker can inject arbitrary scripts that may modify the DOM, submit unauthorized requests (e.g., via CSRF or forged form submissions), or alter displayed content. If the victim is an administrator, the attacker could potentially alter settings, create new users, or change roles. Even for non-admin users, the attacker could manipulate displayed information, leading to misinformation or unauthorized actions being taken by the victim under false pretenses"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While Stored XSS primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, it can also impact availability in certain scenarios. For example, injected scripts could cause browser crashes, infinite loops, or redirect users away from the site, effectively denying access. Additionally, malicious scripts could consume resources or trigger repeated requests that degrade performance. However, these effects are typically secondary and depend on the payload, so the availability impact is generally limited but still present in some exploitation scenarios"
