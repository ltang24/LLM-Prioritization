        "content": "To analyze **CVE-2025-4740** using the **CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics**, we will assess each metric based on the provided description and definitions. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### üîê **CVE-2025-4740 Summary:**\n- **Product**: BeamCtrl Airiana (up to version 11.0)\n- **Vulnerability Type**: Deserialization\n- **Location**: Unknown code in the file `coef`\n- **Attack Vector**: Local\n- **Exploit Availability**: Publicly disclosed and may be used\n- **Impact**: Not explicitly stated, but deserialization vulnerabilities can often lead to code execution or data manipulation.\n\n---\n\n## üîé CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Analysis:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Attack Vector (AV): `Local (L)`**\n\n**Definition**: The vulnerability is exploitable with local access (e.g., physical access or through a local shell).\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- The description explicitly states: **\"The attack needs to be approached locally.\"**\n- This means the attacker must have local access to the system (e.g., logged-in user, local shell, or physical access).\n\n‚úÖ **Value**: `Local (L)`\n\n---\n\n### **2. Attack Complexity (AC): `Low (L)`**\n\n**Definition**: No special conditions are required for exploitation.\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- There is no mention of any unusual or complex conditions that must be met for the attack to succeed.\n- Deserialization vulnerabilities are often straightforward to exploit once an input vector is known.\n- The presence of a **public exploit** suggests that exploitation is not complex.\n\n‚úÖ **Value**: `Low (L)`\n\n---\n\n### **3. Privileges Required (PR): `Low (L)`**\n\n**Definition**: The attacker requires basic user privileges.\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- Since the attack is **local**, some level of access is implied.\n- The description does not say \"no privileges\" or \"requires admin/root,\" so we assume **low privileges** (e.g., a normal user account).\n- Deserialization vulnerabilities often require the attacker to send crafted data to a component, which typically requires some access.\n\n‚úÖ **Value**: `Low (L)`\n\n---\n\n### **4. User Interaction (UI): `None (N)`**\n\n**Definition**: The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- The description does **not** mention any need for user interaction (e.g., clicking a link, opening a file).\n- Deserialization vulnerabilities often occur during automatic processing of input (e.g., loading data), which can happen without user involvement.\n\n‚úÖ **Value**: `None (N)`\n\n---\n\n### **5. Scope (S): `Unchanged (U)`**\n\n**Definition**: The vulnerability does not affect resources beyond the vulnerable component‚Äôs security scope.\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- There is no indication that the vulnerability affects other components or security domains.\n- Unless the deserialization leads to privilege escalation or cross-component compromise (which is not stated), we assume the **scope remains unchanged**.\n\n‚úÖ **Value**: `Unchanged (U)`\n\n---\n\n### **6. Confidentiality Impact (C): `High (H)`**\n\n**Definition**: Total loss of confidentiality, or access to all resources.\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- Deserialization vulnerabilities can often lead to **arbitrary code execution**, which can allow attackers to read sensitive data.\n- Although the exact impact is not stated, the **public exploit** and nature of deserialization suggest a **high risk** to confidentiality.\n\n‚úÖ **Value**: `High (H)` (Assumed based on typical deserialization impact)\n\n---\n\n### **7. Integrity Impact (I): `High (H)`**\n\n**Definition**: Complete loss of integrity, such as unauthorized modification of data.\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- Arbitrary code execution via deserialization can allow attackers to **modify files, settings, or data**.\n- Again, while not explicitly stated, this is a **reasonable assumption** for deserialization flaws.\n\n‚úÖ **Value**: `High (H)`\n\n---\n\n### **8. Availability Impact (A): `High (H)`**\n\n**Definition**: Complete loss of availability (e.g., system crash, service shutdown).\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- If the vulnerability allows code execution, the attacker could crash services or make the system unusable.\n- Deserialization vulnerabilities are often used for **denial-of-service** attacks as well.\n\n‚úÖ **Value**: `High (H)`\n\n---\n\n## üßÆ Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation:\n\nUsing the CVSS v3.1 calculator with the following values:\n\n- AV: L\n- AC: L\n- PR: L\n- UI: N\n- S: U\n- C: H\n- I: H\n- A: H\n\n### üéØ **Base Score: 8.8 (High)**  \n**Vector String**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`\n\n---\n\n## ‚úÖ Summary Table:\n\n| Metric                | Value | Reasoning |\n|-----------------------|-------|-----------|\n| **Attack Vector**     | Local (L) | Exploitation requires local access |\n| **Attack Complexity** | Low (L) | No special conditions mentioned |\n| **Privileges Required** | Low (L) | Likely requires basic user access |\n| **User Interaction**  | None (N) | No user interaction required |\n| **Scope**             | Unchanged (U) | No cross-boundary impact indicated |\n| **Confidentiality**   | High (H) | Potential for full data access |\n| **Integrity**         | High (H) | Potential for data modification |\n| **Availability**      | High (H) | Potential for service disruption |\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to adjust the assumptions or explore the **Temporal** or **Environmental** metrics as well.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The exploitation of this vulnerability requires physical or logical access to the target system where the vulnerable component resides. The description specifies that the attack must be approached locally, indicating that remote execution is not feasible. Therefore, an attacker would need to either have direct access to the device or rely on other methods to place a malicious payload on the system where it could trigger deserialization, such as through local file manipulation or insertion via removable media. This significantly narrows the scope of attack initiation, making broad, remote scanning ineffective for exploitation"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The deserialization flaw depends on how the application handles serialized data within the affected 'coef' file. While deserialization issues can sometimes be exploited directly, many require the presence of specific data structures or predictable object mappings that trigger unsafe operations. The attacker must ensure that the serialized payload adheres to the internal format expectations of the application and can bypass any validation or sanitization steps. Additionally, exploitation may depend on runtime behaviors such as memory handling, object instantiation, or exception catching, which introduces uncertainty beyond the attacker‚Äôs direct control"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to access and manipulate the vulnerable 'coef' file within the application context. This suggests that the attacker requires permission to read from or write to specific directories or file paths that are not universally accessible to anonymous or minimally privileged users. Depending on the deployment configuration of BeamCtrl Airiana, this access may only be granted to users with elevated roles, such as system-level permissions or authenticated user-level access to the underlying operating system or application instance"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The description does not indicate that any user action‚Äîsuch as opening a file, clicking a link, or executing a command‚Äîis required to trigger the exploit. Given that the deserialization occurs in application code, it is likely that the vulnerability can be exploited automatically when the system parses or loads the manipulated 'coef' file. This implies that once the attacker has crafted the malicious input and positioned it where it will be processed, no further assistance or interaction is necessary from a human user to complete the compromise"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides within the 'coef' file of BeamCtrl Airiana up to version 11.0 and is triggered via a deserialization flaw. While it is described as requiring a local attack vector, the nature of insecure deserialization suggests the potential to instantiate or execute unexpected objects. This can lead to execution of arbitrary code or method calls that escape the originally intended scope, particularly if deserialized objects interact with external classes or systems. Thus, exploitation could cross security boundaries by affecting components not originally in scope, such as system-level processes or user privileges if improperly sandboxed"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "Improper deserialization may allow an attacker to instantiate objects that can read arbitrary data from the system depending on the permissions granted to the vulnerable component. If the deserialized object includes functionality to access files or databases, there exists a risk that sensitive internal configuration data, credentials, or user information could be leaked. While the attack is local, if successful exploitation provides elevated access to internal data structures, it compromises the confidentiality of resources managed by the component, especially if access control mechanisms can be bypassed"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Deserialization vulnerabilities are often associated with the ability to alter application behavior or inject malicious objects. In this context, successful exploitation could allow the attacker to supply crafted serialized data that modifies component state or method outcomes. This could lead to unauthorized changes in configuration files, manipulation of stored data, or corruption of application logic. If the application processes user or system inputs based on these objects, their integrity can be compromised, resulting in incorrect outputs or further vulnerable states"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Deserialization attacks can result in resource exhaustion or application crashes by constructing malicious payloads that trigger infinite loops, recursive calls, or excessive memory consumption. Given that the exploit is public and locally accessible, attackers could repeatedly target the vulnerable code in the 'coef' file, resulting in denial-of-service conditions. Even without remote access, exploitation from a compromised local account could degrade the system‚Äôs availability, interrupting services and impacting operational performance of BeamCtrl Airiana installations"
