      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible administrative script, specifically /admin/profile.php, which processes user-supplied input via the 'contactnumber' parameter. Because the attack can be initiated remotely, an attacker does not need physical access or proximity to the target system. Exploitation can occur over standard internet protocols, such as HTTP, allowing the attacker to send crafted requests from any location with network connectivity. This remote accessibility significantly broadens the attack surface and enables exploitation without direct interaction with the host environment"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploit involves injecting malicious SQL statements through a single input parameter without requiring any unusual environmental conditions. There is no indication that the attacker must bypass additional security mechanisms, such as CAPTCHA, input validation filters, or session-based tokens. The vulnerability appears to stem from insufficient sanitization of user input, which means the attacker can execute the exploit using straightforward techniques. No specialized configuration, timing conditions, or race conditions are necessary, making the attack highly repeatable and predictable across different deployments of the affected system"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerable endpoint is located within the administrative section of the application, suggesting that access may be gated behind authentication. However, the description does not specify whether the attacker must be logged in or possess elevated permissions. If the endpoint is exposed without access controls, the attacker could exploit it without any prior authentication. Conversely, if minimal credentials are required, the attacker might need to compromise a low-level account first. Regardless, there is no indication that high-level administrative privileges are necessary to reach the vulnerable functionality"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process involves sending a crafted HTTP request containing malicious SQL code to a server-side script. There is no mention of any requirement for a legitimate user to perform an action such as clicking a link, opening a file, or interacting with the application in a specific way. The attacker can execute the exploit independently, without relying on social engineering or user behavior. This means the compromise can occur without any participation from a human user other than the attacker"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability stems from SQL injection in /admin/profile.php, which is part of the administrative interface. Successful exploitation can affect backend database resources managed by components outside the scope of the vulnerable script. The attack may influence records belonging to other modules within the Zoo Management System, indicating a scope change as it crosses privilege and resource boundaries beyond the originally targeted component"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection vulnerabilities commonly enable unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database. In this case, the attacker could extract personally identifiable information, animal health records, employee contact details, or other confidential admin system data. Because the attacker controls crafted SQL statements, the disclosure could be unrestricted, giving access to the entire database without authentication barriers"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "An attacker exploiting this SQL injection flaw can potentially manipulate or corrupt records in the database. This could include altering admin profile data, animal records, user roles, and system settings. The direct impact is loss of trustworthiness and correctness of stored data, with secondary effects such as misleading reports, improper care decisions, or compromised operational behavior based on tampered inputs"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While SQL injection mainly targets data integrity and confidentiality, it can be repurposed to exhaust system resources. Attackers may execute heavy queries or induce lock conditions that degrade performance or lead to database crashes. In Zoo Management System 2.1, such disruption could halt critical administrative functions, resulting in reduced availability of the dashboard, reports, and system workflows"
