        "content": "Here's a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4486**, based on the official definitions and the provided vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### üîç Vulnerability Summary\n- **Product**: itsourcecode Gym Management System 1.0  \n- **Affected Component**: `/ajax.php?action=delete_plan`  \n- **Vulnerability Type**: SQL Injection via `ID` parameter  \n- **Attack Vector**: Remote  \n- **Exploit Status**: Publicly disclosed and usable  \n- **Impact**: Potential compromise of data integrity and confidentiality\n\n---\n\n### üìä CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Breakdown\n\n| **Metric**              | **Value**       | **Reasoning** |\n|-------------------------|------------------|---------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)**  | **Network (N)**  | The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via HTTP requests to a web endpoint (`/ajax.php`). No physical or local access is required. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)**     | Exploitation requires no special conditions. SQL injection via a simple parameter (`ID`) is a well-known and straightforward attack vector. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None (N)**  | The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The vulnerable endpoint is accessible without prior login or elevated privileges. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)**    | No user interaction is required. The attacker can send crafted requests directly to the vulnerable endpoint. |\n| **Scope (S)**           | **Unchanged (U)** | The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application). There‚Äôs no indication that it affects other components or systems beyond the application. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)** | **High (H)**     | SQL injection can allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials, personal information, or business data. |\n| **Integrity (I)**       | **High (H)**     | Attackers may modify or delete data (e.g., gym plans) via SQL injection, compromising the integrity of the system. |\n| **Availability (A)**    | **Low (L)**      | While not explicitly stated, SQL injection could potentially lead to denial of service (e.g., by deleting records), but the primary impact seems to be on data access and manipulation rather than system availability.\n\n---\n\n### üßÆ CVSS v3.1 Vector String\n\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L\n```\n\n### üìà CVSS Base Score: **9.1 (Critical)**\n\nThis score reflects a **critical vulnerability** due to its remote exploitability, lack of required privileges, and high impact on both confidentiality and integrity.\n\n---\n\nWould you like help calculating the Temporal or Environmental scores next?",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited over a network connection, meaning an attacker does not need physical access to the system. The attacker can initiate the attack from a remote location by sending crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoint, making the exploitation possible from anywhere with network access to the target system"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability does not require any special conditions or configurations beyond what is typically present in a standard deployment of the affected software. The attacker only needs to manipulate the input parameter in a specific way to trigger the SQL injection, without relying on any uncommon or complex preconditions"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need to have any pre-existing access or privileges on the target system. The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user, meaning that no prior authentication or authorization is necessary to carry out the attack"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation of this vulnerability does not require any interaction from a legitimate user of the system. The attacker can perform the exploit independently, without needing a user to click on a link, open a file, or perform any other action"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The SQL injection vulnerability in /ajax.php?action=delete_plan appears to be confined to the Gym Management System component. However, given that SQL injection can allow attackers to execute arbitrary queries, the potential exists for the compromise to extend beyond the immediate scope of the vulnerable component. If the database contains cross-module data or is shared with other applications, an attacker could affect resources outside the originally intended security boundary. This suggests a scope change is possible depending on deployment architecture"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection vulnerabilities often permit unauthorized read access to database contents. In this case, manipulation of the ID parameter could allow attackers to extract sensitive personal information such as user profiles, membership plans, financial records, or login credentials stored in the Gym Management System's database. Since the vulnerability exists in a publicly accessible endpoint, a remote attacker could exploit it to view confidential data without authentication, representing a high confidentiality impact"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection enables attackers not just to view data but also to alter it. The vulnerable endpoint for deleting plans suggests that attackers might manipulate queries to modify or remove arbitrary records. This can affect billing plans, user permissions, or session data, leading to tampered service operations or fraudulent activities. The ability to corrupt system records or introduce malicious changes highlights a serious threat to data integrity"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While the direct functionality involves deletion of plans, an attacker leveraging SQL injection could craft queries that lock database tables, drop critical data, or otherwise degrade system responsiveness. Such actions could render parts of the Gym Management System unusable or unreliable. A targeted attack on resource-intensive queries might exhaust server resources, potentially disrupting availability for legitimate users, indicating a moderate-to-high impact on system availability"
