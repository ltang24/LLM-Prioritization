This implies the vulnerable component is accessible over a network, such as via HTTP(S). |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low**      | No special preconditions or environmental factors are mentioned. Unrestricted file upload is typically straightforward once access is gained. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None**   | The attacker can initiate the attack without any authentication or elevated privileges, indicating unrestricted access to the upload endpoint. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None**     | The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any participation from a legitimate user (e.g., no need to trick someone into clicking). |\n| **Scope (S)**          | **Changed**     | Unrestricted upload commonly allows attackers to upload scripts or executables, potentially impacting other components beyond the vulnerable uploadFile function‚Äîsuch as the server runtime, OS, or external services. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)** | **High**       | If the uploaded files can be executed or accessed, attackers may gain access to sensitive information or further pivot in the system. |\n| **Integrity (I)**      | **High**        | Arbitrary uploads can allow malicious code insertion, defacing web content, or altering business logic. |\n| **Availability (A)**   | **High**        | Malicious uploads may allow denial-of-service attacks, such as uploading oversized or looping files that crash the service or exhaust resources. |\n\n---\n\n### üßÆ CVSS Base Score Calculation\nUsing these values in the [CVSS v3.1 calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1), the vulnerability receives a:\n\n**CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 10.0 (Critical)**  \n**Vector String:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H`\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want help crafting a remediation strategy or writing an advisory.",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "This vulnerability allows exploitation through interfaces exposed to external environments, such as a web application's file upload endpoint. Since the attacker can manipulate upload parameters remotely, no physical proximity to the target system is needed. The access path involves publicly reachable services where an adversary can transmit malicious payloads over internet-connected infrastructure. Exploitation does not depend on internal network positioning or physical device access"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The described flaw involves direct manipulation of an input argument without mention of prerequisite environmental configurations, authentication tokens, or specific timing conditions. No details suggest the need for specialized software states, uncommon resource availability, or system misconfigurations. The condition for triggering the flaw appears to exist by default due to a lack of validation on the file upload interface, making exploitation predictable and repeatable across deployments"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "There is no indication that the attacker needs to authenticate, be part of any user group, or operate within a privileged execution context to exploit the issue. The uploadFile function is described as being vulnerable directly through its input argument, implying that the threat actor can access and misuse the upload endpoint even without any prior system access. The vulnerability exists in the processing logic before any access control enforcement"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attack scenario does not depend on actions taken by a human user to trigger the vulnerability. There is no reference to the need for another user to open a file, click on a link, or install malicious content. The exploit occurs through the service itself and its improper handling of an incoming file upload request, meaning the attacker can initiate and execute the attack fully autonomously without involving other human actors"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The scope of this vulnerability is changed. The unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the FileServiceImpl.java component can affect other components or systems beyond its immediate security scope. For example, if an attacker uploads a malicious script, it could be executed in the context of the web server, potentially compromising other parts of the system or network, thus crossing security boundaries and impacting resources beyond the initial component"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The confidentiality impact is high. An attacker could upload a malicious file that, once executed, allows them to access sensitive information stored on the server or within the application. This could include database contents, configuration files, or other sensitive data that the application manages, leading to significant information disclosure"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The integrity impact is high. By exploiting the unrestricted file upload vulnerability, an attacker can upload files that could modify existing data or introduce malicious code. This could lead to unauthorized changes in the application's data, defacement of web pages, or insertion of backdoors, compromising the integrity of the system and its data"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The availability impact is high. Malicious files uploaded by an attacker could be designed to consume server resources, crash the application, or disrupt service availability. For example, a large file upload or a file containing code that triggers a denial-of-service condition could render the application or server unavailable, significantly impacting service continuity"
