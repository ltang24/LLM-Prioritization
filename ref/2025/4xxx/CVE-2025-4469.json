      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible administrative script, specifically /admin/add-admin.php, which accepts user-supplied input via parameters such as txtusername, txtfullname, txtpassword, and txtpassword2. Because the exploit can be triggered by manipulating these parameters through standard HTTP requests, an attacker does not need physical access or proximity to the target system. Instead, they can initiate the attack from any location with internet connectivity, provided the target system is exposed to the public web. This remote accessibility significantly broadens the attack surface and allows exploitation without direct interaction with the host environment"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploit involves injecting malicious scripts into form fields that are not properly sanitized, leading to cross-site scripting. There is no indication of required environmental conditions such as specific software configurations, timing constraints, or race conditions. The vulnerability appears to be triggered solely by submitting crafted input to the affected endpoint. This suggests that the attacker does not need to manipulate external factors or rely on unpredictable system states. The simplicity of the attack path implies that exploitation is straightforward and does not depend on any uncommon or difficult-to-achieve prerequisites"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerable endpoint is part of the administrative interface, which typically requires some level of access control. However, the exploit targets input fields used during the creation of new admin accounts, which may be accessible to authenticated users with limited privileges. The attacker likely needs to be logged into the system with at least basic access to reach the form and submit malicious data. Full administrative rights are probably not necessary to exploit the vulnerability, but some level of authenticated access is required to interact with the affected functionality"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities typically rely on a victim user loading a page that contains the injected malicious script. In this case, the attacker submits crafted input that is later rendered in the browser of another user, such as an administrator reviewing account details. For the exploit to succeed, a human user must access the compromised page and trigger the execution of the script. This means the attacker cannot achieve the impact in isolation; the presence and action of a legitimate user are essential to complete the attack chain and realize the intended effect"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "This vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization of user-supplied inputs in /admin/add-admin.php, leading to stored or reflected cross-site scripting (XSS). XSS is generally confined to the web application and browser context without directly breaching component boundaries. However, if the payload exploits session management or privileges across components (e.g., admin accounts interacting with other modules), the scope may broaden. At present, based on the disclosed information, the impact appears limited to the same component's context, suggesting that the scope remains unchanged"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "XSS can compromise confidentiality when malicious scripts exfiltrate sensitive data from a victim's session—especially admin or privileged accounts accessing the vulnerable page. In the admin/add-admin.php context, an attacker could craft payloads that capture cookies, session tokens, or form values. If administrators unknowingly trigger the script, it may lead to unauthorized disclosure of credentials or personal information, depending on what the page processes and displays. This points to a potential low to moderate confidentiality impact depending on victim behavior and data exposure"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "While XSS does not directly alter server-side data, it can affect the integrity of client-side interactions. For instance, an attacker could inject JavaScript that modifies the appearance or behavior of admin pages or hijack form submissions to inject malicious content. If the administrator interacts with these manipulated forms, unintended data creation or updates may occur (e.g., rogue admin accounts). This means integrity impact exists primarily through deception and altered user interactions, rather than server-side corruption"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "XSS typically does not impact the availability of the affected system component in terms of uptime or performance. Although it may degrade the user experience or prevent legitimate use of a page (e.g., if malicious scripts crash browser tabs or redirect users continuously), it does not consume backend resources or deny service to the component itself. Unless chained with additional denial-of-service vectors, availability impact is negligible in this case"
