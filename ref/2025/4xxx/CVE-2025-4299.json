        "content": "Here’s a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4299**, based on the official definitions and the vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Attack Vector (AV): **Network (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the `/goform/openSchedWifi` endpoint, which implies network-based access.\n- **Impact**: This is the most remote attack vector, increasing the severity.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ Attack Complexity (AC): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The buffer overflow occurs through direct manipulation of a function (`setSchedWifi`) without requiring any special conditions or environmental factors.\n- **Impact**: No additional complexity makes exploitation straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 Privileges Required (PR): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The description states the attack may be initiated remotely, with no indication that authentication or elevated privileges are needed.\n- **Impact**: This significantly increases the risk, as any remote attacker could potentially exploit it.\n\n---\n\n### 👤 User Interaction (UI): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: There’s no mention of user involvement (e.g., clicking links or opening files). The exploit is triggered by sending crafted requests.\n- **Impact**: No user interaction required makes the vulnerability more dangerous.\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 Scope (S): **Unchanged (U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The buffer overflow affects the same component (Tenda AC1206 firmware) and does not appear to impact other components or security boundaries.\n- **Impact**: The effects are contained within the vulnerable component.\n\n---\n\n### 🔒 Confidentiality Impact (C): **High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Buffer overflows often allow arbitrary code execution, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n- **Impact**: High risk of data exposure.\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 Integrity Impact (I): **High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Successful exploitation could allow modification of system behavior or data, compromising integrity.\n- **Impact**: Trustworthiness of data and operations is at risk.\n\n---\n\n### 🚫 Availability Impact (A): **High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Buffer overflows can crash services or devices, leading to denial of service.\n- **Impact**: System availability may be severely affected.\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 Final CVSS v3.1 Vector & Score\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\nBase Score: 9.8 (Critical)\n```\nThis score reflects a **critical vulnerability** that is **easy to exploit remotely**, requires **no privileges or user interaction**, and can lead to **complete compromise** of confidentiality, integrity, and availability [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4299).\n\nWould you like help comparing this to CVSS v4.0 or exploring mitigation strategies?\n\n\n\n> [0] [NVD - CVE-2025-4299](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4299)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited by interacting with the affected device through its network interface. Since the function setSchedWifi is accessible via the /goform/openSchedWifi endpoint, an attacker does not need physical access to the device. Exploitation is possible over a network connection, allowing attackers to initiate the attack from a remote location without being in close proximity to the device"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploitation of this vulnerability does not appear to require any specific environmental conditions or configurations beyond the device being accessible on the network and running the vulnerable firmware version. The attacker only needs to send a specially crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint to trigger the buffer overflow, and no additional factors, such as timing or race conditions, are mentioned as prerequisites"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerability affects a publicly accessible endpoint, suggesting that the attacker does not need to authenticate or possess any specific privileges on the device to exploit the issue. The function setSchedWifi appears to be exposed without requiring prior login or elevated permissions, enabling unauthorized attackers to exploit the flaw directly"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation does not require any action or involvement from a legitimate user of the device. The attacker can initiate the exploit independently by sending a malicious request to the vulnerable endpoint, and no user interaction, such as clicking a link or opening a file, is necessary for the attack to succeed"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides within the setSchedWifi function of the Tenda AC1206 router, which is a network device component. Since the buffer overflow can be triggered remotely and may allow code execution, it potentially affects the entire device's resources and could impact other interconnected components or services beyond the immediate function. Therefore, exploitation could cross security boundaries, impacting resources outside the initial scope of the vulnerable function, making this scope impact significant."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The buffer overflow vulnerability primarily facilitates remote code execution rather than direct data access. While it could be exploited to gain unauthorized control over the device, there is no explicit indication that sensitive information is directly disclosed or accessed during exploitation. Thus, the confidentiality impact is likely limited unless the attacker leverages the compromise to access stored or transmitted data, which is not explicitly stated in the description."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Exploitation of the buffer overflow can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the device’s privileges, potentially leading to modification or corruption of system configurations, firmware, or other stored data. This could compromise the integrity of the device's operation, settings, or network traffic. Therefore, the vulnerability poses a significant integrity impact by enabling unauthorized alterations to the device’s state or data."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The buffer overflow can cause the device to crash, become unresponsive, or reset, leading to service disruption. Since the attack can be initiated remotely and may result in a denial of service, the vulnerability directly impacts the availability of the router and its network services. Consequently, it can cause downtime or degraded performance until the device is recovered or patched."
