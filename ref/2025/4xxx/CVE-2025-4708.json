      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by manipulating the 'discount' parameter in the /pages/sales_add.php file. This means an attacker does not need physical access to the system and can launch the attack over a network, making the context of exploitation broad and accessible from anywhere with network connectivity to the target system"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "There are no special conditions or configurations required beyond the presence of the vulnerable code. The attacker only needs to craft a specific SQL injection payload and send it to the vulnerable endpoint. This simplicity indicates that the conditions for exploitation are minimal and do not require any unusual or complex setup"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any prior access to the system to exploit this vulnerability. The manipulation of the 'discount' parameter in the HTTP request can be done without any authentication or special privileges, indicating that no initial access or elevated privileges are necessary for a successful attack"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "Exploitation of this vulnerability does not require any action from a user other than the attacker. The SQL injection can be executed solely by the attacker sending a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint, without needing any user to interact with the system during the attack process"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform SQL injection via the 'discount' parameter in the sales_add.php page. Since SQL injection typically targets the backend database, the exploitation can impact resources beyond the immediate component's scope. This means the vulnerability in the web interface affects the underlying database system, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation of data maintained outside the boundary of the affected web page itself. Therefore, it crosses a trust boundary between the frontend and backend components of the application"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection vulnerabilities often enable attackers to craft queries that retrieve sensitive information from the database. In this case, the attacker may access customer records, product details, sales history, or user credentials stored within the sales and inventory database. Given the critical classification and remote exploitability, it's highly plausible that confidential business or personally identifiable data could be extracted without authorization, resulting in a severe confidentiality impact"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "By exploiting the SQL injection vector, an attacker can not only retrieve data but also modify database records. This includes altering sales entries, applying unauthorized discounts, or corrupting transaction logs. Such modifications can jeopardize the accuracy and trustworthiness of the entire inventory and sales tracking process. The remote exploit capability further amplifies this threat, as the attacker doesn’t need access to internal systems to inject malicious SQL commands that could compromise data integrity"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection can be leveraged to execute queries that affect the availability of the database, such as dropping tables or initiating expensive operations that exhaust system resources. In the context of the sales_add.php page, an attacker could potentially overload the system with malicious queries or disable access to critical sales functionality. This would result in service disruptions and downtime, thereby impacting the availability of the affected component and possibly the system as a whole"
