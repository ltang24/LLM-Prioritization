        "content": "Based on the description of **CVE-2025-4360**, we can analyze and assign **CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics** as follows:\n\n---\n\n### üîç **Summary of the Vulnerability**\n- **Product**: itsourcecode Gym Management System 1.0  \n- **Vulnerable File**: `/view_member.php`  \n- **Vulnerability Type**: SQL Injection via `ID` parameter  \n- **Attack Vector**: Remote  \n- **Exploit Status**: Publicly disclosed and usable  \n- **Impact**: Not explicitly stated, but likely includes data exposure and modification due to SQL injection\n\n---\n\n## üßÆ **CVSS v3.1 Base Score Metrics**\n\n| **Metric** | **Value** | **Reasoning** |\n|------------|-----------|----------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)** | **Network (N)** | The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via HTTP request to `/view_member.php` with a manipulated `ID` parameter. No physical or local access is required. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)** | SQL injection typically does not require any special conditions beyond crafting a malicious input. The attacker only needs to send a specially crafted request. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None (N)** | The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The injection occurs via a public-facing parameter (`ID`) in a web-accessible script. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)** | No user interaction is required. The attacker can exploit the vulnerability directly by sending a request. |\n| **Scope (S)** | **Unchanged (U)** | The vulnerable component (the web application) and the impacted resources (database) are within the same security scope. There's no indication that the vulnerability affects another component with a different security authority. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)** | **High (H)** | SQL injection can allow attackers to extract sensitive information from the database, such as user data, credentials, or business-critical information. |\n| **Integrity (I)** | **High (H)** | SQL injection can also allow attackers to modify or delete data in the database, affecting the integrity of the system. |\n| **Availability (A)** | **High (H)** | In many SQL injection cases, attackers can cause denial of service by manipulating queries to crash the database or application. While not explicitly stated, the potential for high availability impact exists. |\n\n---\n\n## üßæ **CVSS Vector String and Score**\n\n**CVSS v3.1 Vector:**\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n```\n\n**Base Score: 9.8 (Critical)**  \nThis is consistent with the classification in the CVE description.\n\n---\n\n## üìå **Conclusion**\n\nCVE-2025-4360 is a **critical** SQL injection vulnerability in a web application endpoint that:\n- Requires no authentication or user interaction\n- Is remotely exploitable\n- Can lead to full compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability\n\nThis makes it a **highly dangerous vulnerability**, especially since the exploit is publicly available. Immediate patching or mitigation is strongly recommended.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help calculating the **Temporal** or **Environmental** scores as well.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible PHP file and is triggered by manipulating a URL parameter, which implies that an attacker can exploit it simply by sending crafted HTTP requests over the internet. No physical access or proximity to the target system is necessary, and the attack can be executed from any location with network connectivity. This remote accessibility significantly broadens the pool of potential attackers and lowers the barrier to initiating an exploit."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation involves injecting malicious SQL code into a parameter without requiring any special environmental conditions or configurations. There is no indication that the target system must be in a specific state, nor does the attack depend on race conditions, timing issues, or other unpredictable factors. The vulnerability appears to be reliably exploitable under default configurations, suggesting that the attacker does not need to overcome any unusual or external hurdles beyond crafting the payload."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attack targets a publicly accessible endpoint and relies on manipulating a query parameter, which typically does not require authentication or elevated access rights. There is no mention of the attacker needing to log in or possess any user role within the application. This implies that the exploit can be performed by any external actor without prior access to the system, making it feasible for unauthenticated users to initiate the attack."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploit mechanism involves direct manipulation of a URL parameter and does not appear to require any action from a legitimate user of the system. There is no indication that a user must click a link, open a file, or perform any task that would facilitate the attack. The attacker can execute the exploit independently, without relying on social engineering or user behavior to trigger the vulnerability."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The scope of this vulnerability is changed. The SQL injection vulnerability in the /view_member.php file of the Gym Management System allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This can affect the database, which is a separate component from the web application itself, thus crossing a security boundary. The exploitation of this vulnerability can impact other components that rely on the database, such as other web pages or services that use the same database for storing and retrieving data"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The confidentiality impact is high. Through SQL injection, an attacker can potentially access sensitive information stored in the database, such as user personal details, membership information, and possibly even credentials. Unauthorized access to this data can lead to significant breaches of privacy and exposure of confidential information"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The integrity impact is high. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can modify or delete data within the database. This could include altering membership records, changing user information, or even adding malicious data. Such actions can corrupt the data integrity, leading to mistrust in the system's data accuracy and reliability"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The availability impact is high. SQL injection can be used to perform operations that degrade the performance of the database, such as executing resource-intensive queries or deleting critical data. This can lead to the database becoming unresponsive or the web application failing to function correctly, resulting in denial of service for legitimate users"
