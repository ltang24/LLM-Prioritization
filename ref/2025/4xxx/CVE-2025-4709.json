      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible PHP file, specifically /pages/transaction_del.php, which processes an 'ID' parameter. Since the attack can be launched remotely, it implies that the vulnerable component is exposed over a network interface such as HTTP. An attacker does not need to be physically present or connected to a local environment; they can initiate the exploit from any location with internet access. This broad accessibility significantly increases the potential attack surface, as it allows exploitation from virtually anywhere without proximity constraints"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploit involves manipulating a single input parameter to trigger a SQL injection, which is a well-known and straightforward attack vector. There is no indication that the attacker must bypass any additional security mechanisms, perform complex steps, or rely on unpredictable environmental factors. The vulnerability does not appear to require specific configurations, timing conditions, or race conditions. Therefore, the conditions necessary for exploitation are minimal and do not depend on external or environmental variables beyond the attacker’s control"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The description does not mention any need for authentication or prior access to the system before exploiting the vulnerability. The fact that the attack can be launched remotely and targets a publicly accessible script suggests that the attacker does not need to log in or possess any user-level or administrative privileges. They can interact with the vulnerable endpoint directly, likely through crafted HTTP requests, without needing to establish a session or gain authorization beforehand"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "There is no indication that a legitimate user must perform any action to facilitate the exploit. The attacker can directly send malicious input to the vulnerable script, and the system processes it without requiring another user to click links, open files, or engage with the application. This means the compromise occurs solely through attacker-controlled actions, and no human intervention or cooperation from a victim is necessary for successful exploitation"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability arises from SQL injection in the 'ID' parameter of /pages/transaction_del.php. Because the SQL injection allows direct manipulation of backend queries, it is likely the exploit affects only the database layer directly tied to the vulnerable web component. Therefore, the scope is considered unchanged since the impact remains confined to the same security authority without crossing into other components or subsystems"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "An attacker exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability could potentially access sensitive data stored in the database, such as customer details, inventory records, sales logs, and user credentials. Given that the application likely manages business-critical information, unauthorized access may result in substantial data leakage, making the confidentiality impact high"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Through manipulation of backend SQL commands, an attacker could alter or delete records—particularly transactions associated with the 'ID' parameter—without proper authorization. This compromises the integrity of the system’s data, allowing for falsification or removal of legitimate records, disrupting business logic and audit trails. Therefore, the integrity impact is also high"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Although SQL injection primarily targets data manipulation and exfiltration, it can be weaponized to affect availability—for instance, through crafted queries that consume excessive resources, drop essential tables, or lock the database. Such abuse could render the system partially or fully inoperable, resulting in notable service disruption. Hence, availability impact is considered high"
