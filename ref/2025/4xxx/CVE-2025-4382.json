      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability remains within the security scope of the GRUB bootloader and does not directly affect other components or systems beyond it. Although the attacker gains access to decrypted data, this occurs due to GRUB’s failure to validate the filesystem and its subsequent behavior in rescue mode. The flaw does not propagate to other components or compromise their security boundaries. Therefore, the scope is considered unchanged, as the impact is confined to the GRUB component and its immediate memory context."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "This vulnerability poses a high confidentiality impact. When GRUB enters rescue mode after filesystem corruption, the disk is already decrypted and the decryption key remains in system memory. An attacker with physical access can exploit this state to read sensitive data without authentication. Since the encryption mechanism is bypassed and no further access controls are enforced at this stage, all data on the disk becomes accessible. This undermines the confidentiality guarantees of the LUKS encryption scheme."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The integrity impact is also high. The attacker can deliberately corrupt the filesystem superblock to trigger GRUB’s rescue mode and gain access to decrypted data. This manipulation of the filesystem constitutes a direct compromise of data integrity. Moreover, the attacker’s ability to force the system into a vulnerable state through crafted corruption means that system files and configurations could be altered or tampered with, potentially leading to further unauthorized modifications or persistent compromise."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The availability impact is considered none. Although GRUB fails to locate a valid filesystem and enters rescue mode, the system does not crash or become entirely unavailable. Instead, it transitions into a limited operational state. There is no indication of resource exhaustion, performance degradation, or denial of service. The vulnerability does not prevent the system from booting or accessing basic functionality, and the attacker’s goal is data access rather than service disruption."

        "content": "To analyze CVE-2025-4382 using the CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics, we will assess **Exploitability** and **Impact** metrics based on the vulnerability description. Below is the detailed reasoning for each metric:\n\n---\n\n### **Exploitability Metrics**\n\n#### **Attack Vector (AV):**  \n**Physical (P)**  \n- The attacker requires **physical access** to the system to exploit the vulnerability. They must corrupt the filesystem superblock and interact with the GRUB rescue mode to access the decrypted data.  \n- **Reasoning:** The vulnerability explicitly states that physical access is required to exploit the flaw.\n\n---\n\n#### **Attack Complexity (AC):**  \n**Low (L)**  \n- Exploiting the vulnerability does not require specialized conditions or significant effort beyond physical access. The attacker only needs to corrupt the filesystem superblock, which is straightforward with physical access.  \n- **Reasoning:** The description does not mention any complex prerequisites or environmental conditions that would make exploitation difficult.\n\n---\n\n#### **Privileges Required (PR):**  \n**None (N)**  \n- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges to exploit the vulnerability. Once they have physical access and corrupt the filesystem, GRUB enters rescue mode, exposing the decrypted data.  \n- **Reasoning:** The vulnerability occurs before any authentication mechanism is enforced.\n\n---\n\n#### **User Interaction (UI):**  \n**None (N)**  \n- Exploitation does not require any interaction from a legitimate user. The attacker can act independently once they have physical access.  \n- **Reasoning:** The attacker controls the entire exploitation process without requiring assistance or interaction from a user.\n\n---\n\n### **Impact Metrics**\n\n#### **Confidentiality (C):**  \n**High (H)**  \n- The vulnerability allows the attacker to access the decrypted contents of the disk, compromising the confidentiality of sensitive data.  \n- **Reasoning:** Since the decryption key is loaded into memory and the disk is already decrypted, the attacker can access all data without restrictions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Integrity (I):**  \n**Low (L)**  \n- The attacker can corrupt the filesystem superblock to trigger the vulnerability, which affects the integrity of the filesystem. However, this does not directly compromise the integrity of the data stored on the disk.  \n- **Reasoning:** While the filesystem is corrupted, the primary impact is on confidentiality, with limited integrity implications.\n\n---\n\n#### **Availability (A):**  \n**None (N)**  \n- The vulnerability does not directly impact the availability of the system or its data. The system remains operational, albeit in a compromised state.  \n- **Reasoning:** The description does not indicate any denial of service or system unavailability caused by the flaw.\n\n---\n\n### **Base Score Calculation**\n\nUsing the CVSS v3.1 formula and the selected metrics:\n\n#### **Exploitability Sub-Score:**\n\\[\n\\text{Exploitability} = 8.22 \\times AV \\times AC \\times PR \\times UI\n\\]\n\\[\nAV = 0.20 \\ (\\text{Physical}), \\ AC = 0.77 \\ (\\text{Low}), \\ PR = 0.85 \\ (\\text{None}), \\ UI = 0.85 \\ (\\text{None})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Exploitability} = 8.22 \\times 0.20 \\times 0.77 \\times 0.85 \\times 0.85 = 1.09\n\\]\n\n#### **Impact Sub-Score:**\n\\[\n\\text{Impact} = 1 - [(1 - C) \\times (1 - I) \\times (1 - A)]\n\\]\n\\[\nC = 0.56 \\ (\\text{High}), \\ I = 0.22 \\ (\\text{Low}), \\ A = 0.00 \\ (\\text{None})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Impact} = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) \\times (1 - 0.22) \\times (1 - 0.00)] = 1 - [0.44 \\times 0.78 \\times 1.00] = 1 - 0.3432 = 0.6568\n\\]\n\n#### **Base Score:**\n\\[\n\\text{Base Score} = \\text{RoundUp}(\\text{min}[(\\text{Impact} + \\text{Exploitability}), 10])\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Base Score} = \\text{RoundUp}(\\text{min}[0.6568 + 1.09, 10]) = \\text{RoundUp}(1.7468) = 6.5\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score:**  \n**6.5 (Medium)**  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Metrics:**\n\n| **Metric**             | **Value**       | **Reasoning**                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)**  | Physical (P)    | Exploitation requires physical access.                                       |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | Low (L)        | Exploitation is straightforward with no complex prerequisites.               |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | None (N)      | No prior authentication or privileges are needed.                            |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | None (N)       | Exploitation does not require user interaction.                              |\n| **Confidentiality (C)** | High (H)        | Decrypted data is fully exposed to the attacker.                             |\n| **Integrity (I)**       | Low (L)         | Filesystem corruption impacts integrity, but data remains mostly intact.     |\n| **Availability (A)**    | None (N)        | No impact on system or data availability.                                    |",

      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "This vulnerability impacts the local system component responsible for disk decryption and boot management, specifically GRUB configured with TPM-based auto-decryption. Since the flaw allows an attacker with physical access to manipulate filesystem integrity and trigger the decryption process, it effectively bypasses security boundaries by enabling access to unencrypted data. The attack exploits the boot process and filesystem state, which are outside the intended security scope of the encrypted disk, thereby affecting resources beyond the original component's security domain."

      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability permits an attacker with physical access to access unencrypted data stored on the disk once the system is in a compromised state. By corrupting the filesystem superblock, the attacker can cause GRUB to enter rescue mode, leaving the decryption key loaded in memory. This scenario enables unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, as the attacker can read unencrypted data directly from the disk or memory, significantly compromising confidentiality of the protected resources."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The flaw involves corruption of the filesystem superblock, which can lead to data inconsistency or corruption of the stored filesystem metadata. Such manipulation can cause the system to misinterpret or modify critical filesystem structures, potentially resulting in data integrity issues. Additionally, the ability to force the system into rescue mode and manipulate the decryption process can lead to further unauthorized modifications or corruption of data, undermining the integrity of the stored information and system state."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "By corrupting the filesystem superblock and forcing the system into rescue mode, the vulnerability can cause service disruption, preventing normal boot and operation of the system. The process of recovery or reconfiguration may require manual intervention, leading to downtime. Moreover, the attack may consume system resources during the recovery process or facilitate further exploitation, thereby degrading the availability of the system and its services."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "This vulnerability does not require any participation from a separate human user for successful exploitation. The flaw arises when GRUB is configured to automatically decrypt LUKS-encrypted disks using keys stored in the TPM. Upon boot, GRUB retrieves the decryption key and loads it into system memory. If an attacker with physical access corrupts the filesystem superblock, GRUB fails to locate a valid filesystem and enters rescue mode. Crucially, this transition occurs after the disk has already been decrypted, and the decryption key remains in memory. The attacker can then interact directly with the GRUB command-line interface to access the decrypted disk contents. No user interaction—such as logging in, clicking, or executing commands—is required from a legitimate user for this attack to succeed. The entire exploitation flow is initiated and completed solely by the attacker, leveraging physical access and GRUB’s behavior in response to filesystem corruption."

Here is the analysis:\n\n### Attack Vector (AV)\n- **Description**: The vulnerability requires physical access to the system to exploit. An attacker must physically interact with the machine to corrupt the filesystem superblock and access the decrypted data.\n- **Metric Value**: **Physical (P)**\n  - **Reasoning**: Since the attacker needs physical access to the system, this is the most restrictive attack vector, which corresponds to the \"Physical\" value in CVSS.\n\n### Attack Complexity (AC)\n- **Description**: The attacker needs to corrupt the filesystem superblock to trigger GRUB's rescue mode. This action does not involve any complex conditions or require additional information beyond physical access.\n- **Metric Value**: **Low (L)**\n  - **Reasoning**: The steps to exploit the vulnerability (corrupting the filesystem to trigger rescue mode) do not involve complex conditions or require additional information.

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have direct physical access to the target system. Remote exploitation is not viable, as the attack depends on manually manipulating the hardware, specifically corrupting the filesystem superblock and observing GRUB’s behavior during boot. This scenario inherently limits the attacker’s proximity to the device and requires interaction with the system outside of typical remote channels. The attacker must be at the system’s location, capable of accessing internal storage or booting the system with altered data structures, making this a highly proximity-dependent exploitation route"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The attack requires the ability to reliably corrupt the filesystem superblock in such a way that GRUB cannot locate the valid filesystem, triggering rescue mode. Achieving this consistently may require specific knowledge of the target’s disk layout, GRUB configuration, and the implementation of auto-decryption using TPM. These conditions are largely outside the attacker’s direct control and may vary between systems. Moreover, ensuring the decryption key is loaded in memory without triggering other security mechanisms presents an additional layer of complexity. The attacker must anticipate and manage boot behavior intricacies in order to succeed"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need to authenticate into the system or hold any operating system-level privileges. Once the disk is decrypted by GRUB during boot, access to memory-resident keys or unencrypted disk contents is possible without prior login. However, the ability to perform the filesystem corruption that induces GRUB into rescue mode may imply some low-level access capabilities, such as booting from external media or modifying disk sectors, which typically don't require operating system authentication but do presume physical control"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The successful exploitation of this flaw does not depend on actions taken by a user during or after system boot. The attacker initiates the compromise through corruption of the disk and subsequent system boot manipulation, entirely independent of any user behavior. No user confirmation, click-through, or execution of scripts by a logged-in user is necessary. The vulnerability manifests automatically once the system boots with a tampered superblock, entering rescue mode and leaving the decrypted key in memory, thus removing user involvement from the attack sequence"

      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "This vulnerability impacts only the affected disk and its associated components, specifically the decryption process and filesystem. Since the attack involves corrupting the filesystem to induce GRUB rescue mode and expose the decrypted data, it does not extend beyond the local disk or system boundary. Therefore, the scope remains confined to the local resource, without affecting other systems or components outside the immediate environment."

      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The flaw allows an attacker with physical access to access unencrypted data stored on the disk once the system enters rescue mode, as the decryption key remains loaded in memory. This results in a significant confidentiality breach, as sensitive information can be disclosed without further authentication. The attack effectively bypasses access controls, directly exposing data that was intended to be protected by encryption."

      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "By corrupting the filesystem superblock, an attacker can cause the system to enter rescue mode, which may lead to data being modified, corrupted, or rendered inaccessible. Although the primary concern is data disclosure, the ability to manipulate filesystem structures also introduces risks of data integrity compromise, as the attacker can potentially alter or delete data during the process, undermining the trustworthiness of stored information."

The process of filesystem corruption and recovery can also consume resources and time, further impacting system availability and operational continuity."
