        "content": "### CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Analysis for CVE-2025-4783\n\n#### **1. Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network, as it involves injecting malicious scripts into a WordPress site via the plugin. The attacker does not need physical or local access to the server or system. The exploitation occurs through the web interface of the vulnerable plugin.\n\n#### **2. Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: Exploiting this vulnerability does not require any special conditions or advanced knowledge. The attacker simply needs to craft a payload and inject it into the vulnerable HTML attributes of the Countdown Timer Widget. There are no significant barriers or dependencies that would increase the complexity of the attack.\n\n#### **3. Privileges Required (PR): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker needs Contributor-level access to exploit the vulnerability. Contributors in WordPress have limited privileges, such as creating and editing their own posts, but they do not have administrative control. Since the attacker needs some level of access but not administrative privileges, this metric is rated as **Low**.\n\n#### **4. User Interaction (UI): Required (R)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malicious script executes only when a user (e.g., an administrator or visitor) accesses a page containing the injected payload. This means that user interaction is necessary for the exploit to succeed.\n\n#### **5. Scope (S): Changed (C)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser. This changes the security scope because the injected script can impact resources outside the vulnerable plugin, such as stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the victim. This constitutes a change in scope.\n\n#### **6. Confidentiality Impact (C): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker can potentially steal sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens) from users who interact with the malicious page. However, the impact is limited to the confidentiality of the affected users and does not compromise the overall system confidentiality.\n\n#### **7. Integrity Impact (I): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker can modify the content of the vulnerable page by injecting malicious scripts. However, the impact is limited to the specific pages where the payload is injected and does not compromise the integrity of the entire system.\n\n#### **8. Availability Impact (A): None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability does not directly affect the availability of the system or its components. It does not cause denial of service or disrupt the functionality of the plugin or the WordPress site.\n\n---\n\n### **CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation**\n\nUsing the CVSS v3.1 formula and the above metrics:\n\n- **AV:** Network (N) = 0.85  \n- **AC:** Low (L) = 0.77  \n- **PR:** Low (L) = 0.62 (for Scope Changed)  \n- **UI:** Required (R) = 0.85  \n- **S:** Changed (C)  \n- **C:** Low (L) = 0.22  \n- **I:** Low (L) = 0.22  \n- **A:** None (N) = 0.00  \n\n### **Exploitability Sub-Score**  \n\\[ Exploitability = 8.22 × AV × AC × PR × UI \\]  \n\\[ Exploitability = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.62 × 0.85 = 2.83 \\]\n\n### **Impact Sub-Score**  \n\\[ Impact = 7.52 × (1 - ((1 - C) × (1 - I) × (1 - A))) \\]  \n\\[ Impact = 7.52 × (1 - ((1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.22) × (1 - 0.00))) \\]  \n\\[ Impact = 7.52 × (1 - (0.78 × 0.78 × 1)) \\]  \n\\[ Impact = 7.52 × (1 - 0.6084) \\]  \n\\[ Impact = 7.52 × 0.3916 = 2.95 \\]\n\n### **Final Score**  \nFor **Scope: Changed**, the formula is:  \n\\[ Base Score = \\text{MIN}[(\\text{Impact} + \\text{Exploitability}), 10] \\]  \n\\[ Base Score = \\text{MIN}[(1.08 × \\text{Impact}) + \\text{Exploitability}, 10] \\]  \n\\[ Base Score = \\text{MIN}[(1.08 × 2.95) + 2.83, 10] \\]  \n\\[ Base Score = \\text{MIN}[3.19 + 2.83, 10] \\]  \n\\[ Base Score = 6.02 \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final CVSS v3.1 Score: 6.0 (Medium)**",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a page containing a malicious Countdown Timer Widget. This implies that the attacker does not need to be physically present or directly connected to the victim's system. Instead, the attacker can exploit the flaw by injecting malicious scripts into a web page hosted on the WordPress site. Once the page is published, any user who accesses it through a standard web browser becomes exposed. This remote exploitation method relies solely on the victim's interaction with the compromised content, making the attack feasible from virtually anywhere with internet access"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation of this vulnerability does not require any unusual or unpredictable conditions beyond the attacker’s control. The attacker simply needs to insert malicious HTML attributes into the Countdown Timer Widget using the plugin’s interface. There are no indications of required environmental factors such as specific server configurations, timing conditions, or race conditions. The plugin’s failure to sanitize and escape input consistently across versions up to 2.7.9.1 means the attack can be executed reliably without needing to bypass additional defenses or manipulate external systems"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have access to the WordPress dashboard with permissions that allow editing or publishing content using the Elementor plugin. Specifically, the attacker must be able to configure the Countdown Timer Widget and inject custom HTML attributes. This level of access is typically granted to users with content creation roles, such as contributors or above. Therefore, the attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability without first obtaining a user account with sufficient privileges to modify page elements through the plugin interface"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The malicious script embedded in the Countdown Timer Widget executes only when a user visits the affected page. This means that the attacker’s payload remains dormant until a human user accesses the compromised content. The user does not need to perform any special actions beyond viewing the page—no clicking, downloading, or form submission is required. However, their presence is essential for the exploit to succeed, as the script relies on the browser’s rendering engine to interpret and execute the injected code"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides within the Exclusive Addons for Elementor plugin and allows Contributor-level users to inject malicious scripts into page content. However, the impact remains confined to the WordPress application layer and does not extend beyond its security scope. There is no indication that exploitation affects other components such as the underlying operating system, database, or hosting environment. Therefore, the vulnerability does not cross security boundaries or impact resources outside the plugin’s domain"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information if the injected script is designed to capture user data. For example, attackers could craft payloads that steal session cookies, authentication tokens, or form input data from users who visit the compromised page. While the plugin itself may not store confidential data, its integration into WordPress pages means that user interactions and potentially sensitive inputs could be exposed, resulting in a low to moderate confidentiality impact depending on site configuration"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability enables attackers to inject arbitrary scripts into page content, which alters the intended behavior and presentation of affected pages. This undermines the integrity of the site’s content and user experience. Although the core data stored in the backend may remain unchanged, the visible output and client-side execution are compromised. This manipulation can mislead users, deface content, or redirect them to malicious sites, representing a moderate impact to data integrity within the application context"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Stored XSS typically does not directly affect the availability of the vulnerable component. However, if the injected scripts are crafted to perform resource-intensive operations or trigger denial-of-service conditions (e.g., infinite loops, large DOM manipulations), they could degrade performance or crash the browser for users accessing the page. Still, such outcomes are not inherent to the vulnerability itself and depend on the attacker’s payload. Therefore, the availability impact is generally considered low unless exploited in a targeted manner"
