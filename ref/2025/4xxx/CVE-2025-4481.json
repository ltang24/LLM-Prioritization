        "content": "Here’s a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4481**, a SQL injection vulnerability in SourceCodester Apartment Visitor Management System 1.0 [[0]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4481):\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via manipulation of a web request to `/search-result.php`. This implies the attacker can exploit it over a network without physical or local access.\n- **Value**: **Network**\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: SQL injection typically requires no special conditions beyond crafting a malicious input. There are no indications of environmental dependencies or unpredictable factors.\n- **Value**: **Low**\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without authentication or prior access. The injection occurs through a public-facing parameter (`searchdata`).\n- **Value**: **None**\n\n---\n\n### 👤 **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The exploit does not require any user to click, log in, or perform actions. The attacker directly sends a crafted request.\n- **Value**: **None**\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability affects the same security scope—the web application itself. There’s no indication that it impacts other components or systems beyond the vulnerable one.\n- **Value**: **Unchanged**\n\n---\n\n### 🔒 **Confidentiality Impact (C): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: SQL injection may allow access to sensitive data, but the description doesn’t confirm full data exposure. A conservative estimate is partial data leakage.\n- **Value**: **Low**\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 **Integrity Impact (I): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker may be able to manipulate queries or insert data, but there’s no evidence of full control or data corruption.\n- **Value**: **Low**\n\n---\n\n### 🚦 **Availability Impact (A): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: SQL injection can potentially disrupt service (e.g., via denial-of-service queries), but the description doesn’t suggest significant service outage.\n- **Value**: **Low**\n\n---\n\n### 📊 **CVSS v3.1 Vector String**\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L\n```\n\n### 🔥 **Base Score: 7.3 (High Severity)**\nThis score reflects a remotely exploitable vulnerability with no user interaction or privileges required, and moderate impacts to confidentiality, integrity, and availability [[0]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4481).\n\nWould you like help comparing this to CVSS v4.0 or exploring mitigation strategies?\n\n\n\n> [0] [CVE-2025-4481 - Vulnerability Details - OpenCVE](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4481)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a publicly accessible web application endpoint, specifically within the /search-result.php file. Exploitation involves manipulating the 'searchdata' parameter to inject malicious SQL statements. Since this parameter is processed by the server when handling HTTP requests, an attacker can initiate the exploit from any location with internet access, without needing physical proximity or access to internal infrastructure. This makes the exploitation feasible from a remote context, relying solely on the ability to send crafted requests to the affected server"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploit requires no unusual environmental conditions or configurations beyond the default deployment of the vulnerable application. The SQL injection is triggered through direct manipulation of a query parameter, which suggests that the vulnerability is exposed without needing to bypass additional security mechanisms, such as input validation or authentication gates. There are no indications of race conditions, timing dependencies, or prerequisite system states that would complicate exploitation. Therefore, the attacker does not depend on any unpredictable or external factors to succeed"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attack targets a public-facing script that processes user input without requiring prior authentication. The vulnerable parameter is accessible in the URL query string, implying that the attacker does not need to log in or possess any user account to reach the vulnerable code path. This means the attacker can exploit the issue without having any access rights or credentials within the application, making the attack viable from an unauthenticated standpoint"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not rely on any actions from a legitimate user. The attacker can directly send malicious input to the vulnerable endpoint and receive a response from the server without requiring a user to click links, open files, or perform any other interaction. The vulnerability is triggered entirely through server-side processing of crafted input, and the success of the attack is independent of any user behavior or cooperation"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides within the /search-result.php component of the system, which processes user input for search functionality. Exploiting the SQL injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially affecting the database and related backend resources. Since the attack can be initiated remotely and can lead to data extraction or modification beyond the immediate component, it crosses security boundaries, impacting other system resources and possibly compromising the broader application environment."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The SQL injection vulnerability enables an attacker to access sensitive data stored within the database, such as user information, personal details, or other confidential records managed by the system. By manipulating the searchdata argument, an attacker can craft queries to extract confidential information, leading to significant disclosure risks and undermining data privacy controls."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Through SQL injection, an attacker can modify or corrupt data within the database, such as altering user records, changing system configurations, or inserting malicious data. This compromises the integrity of the stored information, potentially leading to inconsistent or malicious data states, which can affect system operations and trustworthiness."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While SQL injection primarily impacts data confidentiality and integrity, it can also lead to availability issues if exploited to perform actions like database crashes, resource exhaustion, or denial of service attacks. Malicious queries could cause the database or application to become unresponsive or degrade performance, thereby affecting the availability of the system for legitimate users."
