Here's a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4226**, based on the official definitions and the vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### ðŸ§­ CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Analysis\n\n| Metric | Value | Reasoning |\n|--------|-------|-----------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)** | **Network (N)** | The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via a web interface (`/add-computer.php`), meaning no physical or local access is required. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)** | SQL injection typically requires no special conditions beyond crafting a malicious input. No unpredictable factors or environmental dependencies are mentioned. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None (N)** | The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without authentication or prior accessâ€”just by sending crafted requests to the affected endpoint. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)** | The exploit does not require any user to click, approve, or interact. Itâ€™s fully attacker-driven. |\n| **Scope (S)** | **Unchanged (U)** | The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the web application itself). There's no indication that it impacts other components or systems outside its boundary. |\n| **Confidentiality Impact (C)** | **High (H)** | SQL injection can expose sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal info, or system configurations. |\n| **Integrity Impact (I)** | **High (H)** | Attackers may modify or delete data in the database, compromising its integrity. |\n| **Availability Impact (A)** | **High (H)** | SQL injection can be used to corrupt or delete data, or even crash the database, leading to service disruption. |\n\n---\n\n### ðŸ§® Final CVSS v3.1 Vector & Score\n\n**Vector String:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`  \n**Base Score:** **9.8 (Critical)** [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4226)\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to compare this with CVSS v4.0 or explore mitigation strategies.\n\n\n\n> [0] [NVD - CVE-2025-4226](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4226)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible PHP script, specifically /add-computer.php, which processes user-supplied input via parameters such as 'compname' and 'comploc'. Because this script is exposed over HTTP and accepts input directly from client requests, an attacker can exploit it without needing physical access or proximity to the target system. The attack can be initiated from any location with internet connectivity, making it feasible for remote exploitation through standard web request mechanisms such as crafted URLs or POST data sent to the server"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation of this vulnerability does not appear to depend on any unusual environmental conditions or specific configurations beyond the default deployment of the application. The SQL injection flaw is triggered by manipulating input parameters, which suggests that the application fails to properly sanitize user input. No evidence indicates that the attacker must bypass additional security mechanisms, perform timing-based operations, or rely on race conditions. Therefore, the exploit can be executed reliably under typical operating conditions without requiring the attacker to adapt to unpredictable factors"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerable endpoint accepts unauthenticated input, and the SQL injection occurs during the processing of parameters in a publicly accessible script. This implies that the attacker does not need to log in or possess any form of user credentials to reach the vulnerable code path. The flaw is triggered simply by sending malicious input to the server, indicating that the attacker can operate with the same level of access as any anonymous user visiting the site. No prior elevation of privileges or account access is necessary to initiate the attack"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is triggered by direct manipulation of HTTP request parameters and does not require any action from a legitimate user of the system. The attacker can craft and send malicious requests independently, without relying on a victim to click a link, open a file, or perform any other interaction. The compromise occurs entirely through server-side processing of attacker-controlled input, meaning that the success of the exploit is not contingent on user behavior or cooperation"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows remote attackers to exploit SQL injection in the /add-computer.php endpoint by manipulating the compname or comploc parameters. Since SQL queries typically interact with the database backend, a successful exploit could allow attackers to access or alter data across multiple componentsâ€”not just the add-computer functionality. This suggests that the impact likely extends beyond the original component's security scope, crossing boundaries between presentation and data layers. Thus, the scope is changed"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "Through SQL injection, an attacker may gain unauthorized read access to the entire database managed by the Cyber Cafe Management System. This could expose sensitive customer details, system usage logs, or even credentials if improperly stored. Because the vulnerability affects a core input field that interacts with the database without proper sanitization, data disclosure is a high riskâ€”especially given the public availability of the exploit and remote execution capabilities"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Once inside the database layer via SQL injection, attackers could tamper with records by injecting malicious queries that update or delete data. This compromises trust in system operations, allowing adversaries to rename computers, falsify usage records, or install backdoors into the schema. The compromised input field directly feeds database commands, elevating the threat to data reliability and system integrity. In cyber cafe environments, such disruptions could falsify billing, session times, or machine status"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Availability could be degraded if attackers craft SQL payloads that trigger resource exhaustion (e.g., heavy queries or loops) or denial of service via database corruption. A successful attack could crash the system or render key functionalities inoperableâ€”especially since /add-computer.php likely serves an administrative role. Malformed queries may also cause unexpected behavior that cascades into broader application outages or forces emergency recovery efforts, disrupting operations for both staff and customers"
