      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible script (/search.php) that processes user-supplied input via the 'searchdata' parameter. Because this script is reachable over standard HTTP/S protocols, an attacker does not need to be physically present or connected to a local network. They can initiate the attack from any location with internet access, targeting the server directly through crafted requests. This remote accessibility significantly broadens the attack surface, allowing exploitation from virtually anywhere without proximity constraints"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation method involves injecting malicious SQL statements into a parameter that is not properly sanitized. This type of attack does not rely on unpredictable environmental factors or specific system configurations beyond the vulnerable code itself. There are no indications that the attacker must bypass additional security mechanisms, such as input filters or authentication gates, nor are there dependencies on timing, race conditions, or system states. The exploit is straightforward and repeatable under typical deployment conditions"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests that include the vulnerable 'searchdata' parameter. If the /search.php endpoint is publicly accessible without authentication, then no prior access rights are needed. However, if the endpoint requires login or session initiation, the attacker would need basic access credentials to reach the vulnerable functionality. In such a case, the attacker would operate with limited permissions, sufficient only to interact with the search feature, not with administrative or system-level controls"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attack targets a server-side script and is triggered by sending crafted input directly to the application. There is no indication that a human user must perform any action, such as clicking a link, opening a file, or interacting with the attacker, for the exploit to succeed. The compromise occurs entirely through automated request handling by the server, meaning the attacker can execute the exploit without relying on any user behavior or cooperation"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides within the /search.php functionality of the PHPGurukul/Campcodes Cyber Cafe Management System 1.0. Since the SQL injection can be exploited remotely and potentially allows attackers to execute arbitrary queries, it can impact other database components and possibly affect the broader system environment. This indicates a scope change beyond the initial component, as malicious actors could leverage the vulnerability to access or manipulate data across multiple system boundaries, thus impacting resources outside the immediate search functionality."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The SQL injection vulnerability enables attackers to craft malicious queries that could retrieve sensitive data stored within the database, such as user information, credentials, or other confidential records managed by the system. Exploiting this flaw could lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, compromising user privacy and system security. Therefore, the confidentiality impact is significant, as it directly affects the secrecy and privacy of stored data."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Through SQL injection, an attacker could modify or corrupt data within the database, such as altering user records, transaction logs, or configuration settings. This manipulation could undermine data integrity, leading to inaccurate or maliciously altered information being used by the system. The potential for data tampering indicates a high integrity impact, as the trustworthiness of the data could be compromised, affecting system operations and decision-making processes."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While the primary concern of SQL injection is data confidentiality and integrity, exploitation can also lead to denial-of-service conditions if the attacker executes resource-intensive queries or crashes the database server. Such actions could disrupt the normal functioning of the system, rendering search features or entire services unavailable temporarily or persistently. Consequently, the vulnerability poses a notable risk to system availability, especially if exploited at scale or in conjunction with other attacks."
