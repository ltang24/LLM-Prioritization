No physical or local access is required. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)**     | SQL injection typically requires no special conditions beyond crafting a malicious input. The attacker only needs to manipulate the `id` parameter. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None (N)**  | The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any privileges to exploit the vulnerability. The URL is accessible without login. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)**     | No user interaction is required. The attacker can send a crafted request directly to the vulnerable endpoint. |\n| **Scope (S)**            | **Unchanged (U)** | The vulnerability affects the same security scope (the stock management system backend). There's no indication that it impacts other components or systems. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)**  | **High (H)**     | SQL injection can allow attackers to extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials, inventory records, or financial data. |\n| **Integrity (I)**        | **High (H)**     | Attackers may be able to modify or delete database records, compromising the integrity of the system‚Äôs data. |\n| **Availability (A)**     | **High (H)**     | SQL injection can be used to drop tables or otherwise disrupt database functionality, leading to denial of service. |\n\n---\n\n### üßÆ CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation\n\nUsing the selected metrics:\n\n- **AV:** Network  \n- **AC:** Low  \n- **PR:** None  \n- **UI:** None  \n- **S:** Unchanged  \n- **C:** High  \n- **I:** High  \n- **A:** High  \n\nThis results in a **CVSS v3.1 Base Score of 10.0 (Critical)**.\n\n---\n\n### üìå Summary\n\nThis vulnerability is **critical** due to:\n\n- Remote exploitability without authentication\n- No user interaction required\n- Full impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability\n\nIt represents a classic high-risk SQL injection scenario that could lead to complete system compromise.\n\nWould you like help calculating the Temporal or Environmental scores next?",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited over a network connection by an attacker who can send crafted HTTP requests directly to the application's web interface. Since the attack involves manipulating URL parameters accessible through standard web interactions, the attacker does not need physical access or local system privileges, making remote exploitation feasible without prior access to the target environment."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to craft a specific input that manipulates the URL parameter to inject malicious SQL code. No additional complex conditions, special configurations, or environmental factors are necessary; the attacker simply needs to identify the vulnerable parameter and send a suitable request. The process does not depend on timing, specific system states, or other environmental variables, indicating a straightforward attack scenario once the vulnerability is known."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any existing user privileges within the application or system to initiate the attack. The attack is performed externally by sending specially crafted requests through the web interface, meaning the attacker operates with no prior authorization or credentials. The exploitation relies solely on the application's handling of input parameters without requiring elevated or authenticated access."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attack does not require any action or participation from legitimate users of the system. The attacker can perform the exploit independently by sending malicious requests directly to the server. No human user within the target environment needs to open links, click buttons, or perform any other interaction; the attack is fully automated from the attacker's side and does not depend on user responses or actions."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible administrative endpoint and is triggered via SQL injection through the 'id' parameter. Based on CVSS v3.1 definitions, the impact remains confined to the same component‚Äîthe Stock Management System‚Äîwithout affecting other systems or crossing trust boundaries. Therefore, the scope is considered unchanged, as the exploit does not extend beyond the vulnerable component‚Äôs security authority"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection vulnerabilities often allow attackers to extract sensitive data from backend databases. In this case, the 'id' parameter manipulation could enable unauthorized access to inventory records, user credentials, or other confidential business data stored in the Stock Management System. Since the attacker can remotely query and retrieve data without proper authorization, the confidentiality impact is rated as low to moderate, depending on the database schema and access controls"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "An attacker exploiting this SQL injection could potentially alter database records, such as modifying inventory quantities, supplier information, or transaction logs. This compromises the trustworthiness of the system‚Äôs data and could lead to financial discrepancies or operational errors. The ability to inject arbitrary SQL commands implies a tangible risk to data integrity, warranting a low to moderate impact rating under CVSS v3.1"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While SQL injection primarily targets data access and manipulation, it can also be used to execute commands that degrade system performance or crash the database (e.g., through heavy queries or deletion of critical tables). If exploited maliciously, this could result in temporary service outages or degraded performance of the Stock Management System. Thus, the availability impact is considered low to moderate, contingent on the attacker‚Äôs intent and the system‚Äôs resilience"
