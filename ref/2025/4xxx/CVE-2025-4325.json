        "content": "Based on the official CVSS v3.1 definitions and the details provided for **CVE-2025-4325**, here is a full analysis of the **Base Metrics**, along with reasoning for each:\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 **Exploitability Metrics**\n\n| Metric | Value | Reasoning |\n|--------|-------|-----------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)** | **Network (N)** | The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via a web interface (`/admin/category/add.do`), which implies network access [[0]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4325). |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)** | No special conditions or environmental factors are required beyond sending a crafted request with a malicious `Name` parameter. This is typical for reflected or stored XSS [[0]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4325). |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **High (H)** | The vulnerable endpoint is under `/admin/`, suggesting that the attacker must be authenticated with administrative privileges to access and exploit it [[0]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4325). |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **Required (R)** | XSS typically requires a victim to interact with the malicious payload (e.g., viewing a page with injected script), so user interaction is necessary [[0]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4325). |\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 **Impact Metrics**\n\n| Metric | Value | Reasoning |\n|--------|-------|-----------|\n| **Scope (S)** | **Unchanged (U)** | The impact is confined to the same security authority (e.g., the web application). There's no indication that other components or systems are affected [[0]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4325). |\n| **Confidentiality Impact (C)** | **None (N)** | No evidence that sensitive data is exposed directly through this XSS vulnerability [[0]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4325). |\n| **Integrity Impact (I)** | **Low (L)** | XSS can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts, potentially altering content or misleading users, but not in a way that compromises system integrity deeply [[0]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4325). |\n| **Availability Impact (A)** | **None (N)** | XSS does not affect system availability; it doesn’t crash or deny access to the application [[0]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4325). |\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 **CVSS v3.1 Vector and Score**\n\n- **Vector String**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N`\n- **Base Score**: **2.4 (Low)** [[0]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4325)\n\n---\n\n### 📝 Summary\n\nThis vulnerability is a **low-severity cross-site scripting issue** in an admin-only page. While it can be exploited remotely, it requires **high privileges** and **user interaction**, and its impact is limited to **minor integrity concerns** without affecting confidentiality or availability.\n\nWould you like help comparing this to similar vulnerabilities or exploring mitigation strategies?\n\n\n\n> [0] [CVE-2025-4325 - Vulnerability Details - OpenCVE](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2025-4325)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker from a remote location over the internet. The attacker does not need to be physically close to the system or within a specific network segment. The exploitation occurs through the manipulation of a web request parameter, making it possible to initiate the attack from any location with internet access"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability does not require any special conditions or configurations beyond what is typically present in a web application. The attacker only needs to craft a specific web request with a manipulated parameter. There are no additional steps or complex conditions that need to be met for the attack to succeed"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker needs to have access to the web application's category management page, which implies some level of access to the application. However, it does not necessarily require high-level administrative privileges. Basic user access to the relevant functionality is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation of this vulnerability does not require any action from other users. The attacker can execute the attack independently by sending a crafted request to the server. No other user needs to be involved or perform any actions for the attack to be successful"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides within the Category Management Page's add operation, specifically targeting a component of the application. Since the cross-site scripting (XSS) attack exploits the web interface without necessarily affecting other system components or crossing security boundaries, the scope remains confined to the affected web application layer. Unless the XSS is leveraged to perform further malicious actions that impact other components or escalate privileges, it does not inherently extend beyond its initial context, indicating a limited scope impact."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "This XSS vulnerability primarily involves injecting malicious scripts into the web interface, which can lead to the theft of session tokens, cookies, or other sensitive data stored or accessible within the browser context. However, it does not directly expose or disclose server-side confidential information or data repositories. The confidentiality impact is therefore limited to potential information leakage via compromised client-side data or session hijacking, rather than direct access to protected resources."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows manipulation of user input through the 'Name' argument, leading to cross-site scripting. While this can influence client-side behavior and potentially deceive users, it does not directly modify or corrupt server-side data or system configurations. Unless combined with other vulnerabilities, the integrity of the underlying data or system remains unaffected, as the attack primarily exploits the presentation layer without altering stored data or system integrity."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Cross-site scripting exploits generally do not cause direct disruption of service or resource exhaustion. The attack may lead to browser crashes or degraded user experience if exploited maliciously, but it does not inherently disable the web application or exhaust server resources. Therefore, the impact on availability is minimal, limited to potential user interface issues or temporary inconvenience rather than sustained service outages."
