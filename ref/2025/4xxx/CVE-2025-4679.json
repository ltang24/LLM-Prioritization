      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "Exploitation of this vulnerability occurs through mechanisms that do not rely on physical access or proximity to the target device. Instead, attackers interact with the backup service remotely, likely through standard APIs, authentication portals, or cloud-based interfaces exposed over the internet. This indicates that attackers can initiate the exploit from geographically distant locations using regular network connectivity, assuming they have authorized access credentials. Therefore, the compromise pathway exists entirely within a remote, network-based scope without localized technical dependencies"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The vulnerability does not appear to require any rare environmental or platform-specific preconditions for successful exploitation. There is no mention of system misconfiguration, race conditions, or timing requirements. Since the attackers are already authenticated and the advisory indicates no customer remediation steps are necessary, it suggests that the flaw resides in a core logical or architectural implementation. The vulnerable component is likely exposed in typical default configurations, making the exploitation process straightforward without needing to align multiple variables or environmental factors"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To exploit this flaw, the attacker must already possess access rights within the backup system’s infrastructure. This means they are not simply unauthenticated users probing externally but have already undergone an authorization process that assigns them a recognized role. These permissions may allow them to query internal mechanisms, access stored objects, or misuse metadata. However, their access is not unlimited—they are constrained by the access control policies that the system enforces, and the exploit works within those boundaries to extract confidential data"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "No evidence suggests that an external user must perform any manual tasks such as clicking, downloading, or launching applications to trigger the vulnerability. The extraction of sensitive information occurs entirely within the system's operational context and is initiated by an attacker using previously acquired access credentials. As a result, the compromise is automated from the attacker’s side and does not depend on social engineering, phishing, or user error. System users remain passive and uninvolved during the attack sequence"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in Synology Active Backup for Microsoft 365 allows remote authenticated attackers to access sensitive information, which indicates that exploitation could impact resources beyond the immediate component. Since the attacker can obtain data via unspecified vectors, it suggests that the breach may extend beyond the local component, potentially affecting other interconnected systems or data repositories within the broader environment. Therefore, the scope is considered to be beyond the initial component, impacting other resources or security boundaries."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability enables attackers with authentication to obtain sensitive information, indicating a high impact on confidentiality. This could include access to user data, configuration details, or other protected information managed by the component. Since the attacker can access data via unspecified vectors, it poses a significant risk of unauthorized disclosure, compromising the confidentiality of the information resources handled by the system."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVE description specifies that the vulnerability allows information disclosure but does not mention any capability to modify, corrupt, or delete data. The impact is limited to obtaining sensitive information without affecting the integrity of the data or the system itself. Therefore, the potential for data modification or corruption is minimal or nonexistent, indicating no significant integrity impact."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability does not suggest any disruption to the service or system availability. Since the attack vector is focused on information disclosure and there is no indication of service degradation, resource exhaustion, or system crashes, the availability of the component remains unaffected. The primary concern is data confidentiality rather than service availability."
