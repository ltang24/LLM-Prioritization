No physical or local access is required. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)**     | SQL injection typically requires no special conditions beyond crafting a malicious input. The attacker only needs to manipulate the `email` parameter. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None (N)**   | The attack targets a public-facing password reset page. No authentication or prior access is needed. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)**     | The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any user involvement. The injection occurs server-side upon request processing. |\n| **Scope (S)**           | **Unchanged (U)** | The vulnerable component (web application) and the impacted resources (database) are within the same security scope. No cross-boundary impact is indicated. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)** | **High (H)**      | SQL injection can allow attackers to extract sensitive data such as user credentials, emails, or other private records. |\n| **Integrity (I)**       | **High (H)**      | Attackers may modify or delete data in the database, compromising its integrity. |\n| **Availability (A)**    | **High (H)**      | SQL injection can be used to drop tables or disrupt database operations, leading to denial of service. |\n\n---\n\n### üîê Summary of CVSS Vector\n\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n```\n\nThis vector string represents a **critical** vulnerability with a **CVSS Base Score of 9.8**, which aligns with the severity classification mentioned in the CVE description.\n\n---\n\nWould you like help calculating the Temporal or Environmental metrics next?",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited over a network connection without requiring physical access or local system interaction. An attacker can send specially crafted requests over the internet to the affected application's endpoint, making remote exploitation feasible without prior access to the system or network segment."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability involves constructing a malicious input that manipulates the email argument parameter in the password reset functionality. No additional specialized conditions or configurations are necessary beyond standard network access and the presence of the vulnerable input handling, indicating minimal environmental or contextual requirements for successful exploitation."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any existing user privileges or authenticated access to the system to initiate the attack. The vulnerability resides in a publicly accessible script, and exploiting it does not depend on prior authentication or elevated permissions, allowing an attacker to perform the attack from an unauthenticated state."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attacker can initiate the attack independently by sending malicious requests to the server. No involvement or action from other users or system administrators is necessary for the exploitation to succeed. The attack does not depend on any user performing specific actions or providing additional input beyond the malicious request itself."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The CVSS v3.1 vector for CVE-2025-4698 indicates Scope: Unchanged (S:U), meaning the vulnerability does not cross security boundaries or affect components outside the vulnerable one. The SQL injection occurs within the /admin/forget-password.php endpoint of the PHPGurukul Directory Management System, and its impact is confined to the same application context. There is no evidence that exploitation would affect other systems or components beyond the vulnerable web application itself"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVSS v3.1 rating assigns a Low Confidentiality Impact (C:L), suggesting that successful exploitation may allow limited access to sensitive data. In the context of a SQL injection in a password recovery form, an attacker could potentially extract user email addresses or hashed passwords stored in the database. However, the scope of data exposure is likely constrained to the application's user records and does not include broader system-level secrets or external data sources"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is rated with Low Integrity Impact (I:L), which implies that an attacker may be able to modify some data but not in a way that fundamentally compromises the system‚Äôs trustworthiness. Through SQL injection, an attacker could potentially alter user account details or inject unauthorized entries into the database. However, the lack of elevated privileges and the limited scope of the vulnerable endpoint restrict the extent of data corruption or unauthorized modification"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Availability Impact is also rated Low (A:L), indicating that exploitation may cause minor disruptions but not complete denial of service. SQL injection could be used to craft queries that consume database resources or slow down response times, but there is no indication that the vulnerability enables persistent service outages or resource exhaustion. The attack does not appear to target system-level availability mechanisms or infrastructure components"
