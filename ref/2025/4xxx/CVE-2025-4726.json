      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides within a web application component accessible over the internet, allowing an attacker to send maliciously crafted requests directly to the server hosting the application. Since the attacker can initiate the attack remotely without requiring physical access or proximity, the exploitation can be performed from any location with network connectivity to the target system, making the attack vector highly accessible and not limited by network topology or local access constraints."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability involves manipulating a specific parameter within a web request, which is a straightforward action that does not depend on complex conditions or require the attacker to bypass multiple layers of security. There are no special configurations, environmental prerequisites, or timing considerations needed; the attacker simply needs to craft an appropriate input and send it to the vulnerable endpoint. The attack does not rely on exploiting multiple chained vulnerabilities or overcoming additional security controls, indicating a low level of complexity in the exploitation process."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To successfully exploit the vulnerability, the attacker does not need any prior access rights or elevated permissions within the application or underlying system. The attack can be carried out using an unauthenticated user account or even without any user credentials, as the malicious input is sent directly to the web interface. The attacker’s actions are limited to sending specially crafted requests, and no prior authorization or privilege escalation is necessary to trigger the SQL injection vulnerability."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not require any action or participation from legitimate users of the system beyond the attacker themselves. The attacker can initiate the attack independently by interacting directly with the web application's interface, without prompting or convincing other users to perform specific actions. There is no need for a user to open malicious links, execute files, or perform any activity that would facilitate the attack; the attacker’s input alone suffices to trigger the vulnerability."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides within the /view_student.php component, which processes user-supplied input to perform SQL queries. Exploitation via SQL injection can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, which may extend beyond the immediate component. If the database or backend systems are compromised, the impact could cross security boundaries, affecting other interconnected components or data stores. Therefore, the scope is considered to extend beyond the initial module, impacting resources beyond its original security domain."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The SQL injection vulnerability can enable an attacker to retrieve sensitive data stored within the database, such as student records, personal information, or other confidential resources managed by the system. By manipulating the 'ID' parameter, an attacker could craft queries to disclose data that should be restricted, leading to significant confidentiality breaches. As such, the potential for unauthorized data access indicates a high confidentiality impact."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Exploiting the SQL injection could allow an attacker to modify, insert, or delete data within the database. This could include altering student records, grades, or other critical information, thereby compromising data integrity. The attacker might also execute commands that corrupt or manipulate data structures, leading to inconsistent or unreliable information within the system. Consequently, the integrity of the data is at substantial risk due to this vulnerability."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While SQL injection primarily affects data confidentiality and integrity, it can also impact system availability if exploited to cause database crashes, resource exhaustion, or denial of service conditions. For example, an attacker could execute resource-intensive queries or delete critical data, leading to system downtime or degraded performance. Although not explicitly stated, the potential for such disruptive actions indicates that availability could be adversely affected in a successful attack."
