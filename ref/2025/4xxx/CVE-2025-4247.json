Here's a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4247**, based on the official definitions and the vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### üß≠ Exploitability Metrics\n\n- **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**\n  - The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via manipulation of a URL parameter (`ID` in `/delete_task.php`), indicating no physical or local access is required.\n  - **Reasoning:** SQL injection via HTTP request is a classic remote attack vector.\n\n- **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**\n  - No special conditions or environmental factors are mentioned that would complicate exploitation.\n  - **Reasoning:** SQL injection typically requires only crafting a malicious input string; no unpredictable variables are involved.\n\n- **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**\n  - The description does not mention any authentication or access control requirements.\n  - **Reasoning:** If the vulnerable endpoint is publicly accessible, an attacker can exploit it without logging in.\n\n- **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**\n  - The exploit does not require any action from a user (e.g., clicking a link or opening a file).\n  - **Reasoning:** The attacker directly interacts with the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n---\n\n### üîê Impact Metrics\n\n- **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**\n  - The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the web application itself).\n  - **Reasoning:** There's no indication that exploitation affects other components or systems beyond the application.\n\n- **Confidentiality Impact (C): High (H)**\n  - SQL injection can allow attackers to read sensitive data from the database.\n  - **Reasoning:** Attackers may extract user credentials, personal data, or other confidential records.\n\n- **Integrity Impact (I): High (H)**\n  - SQL injection can be used to modify or delete data.\n  - **Reasoning:** The vulnerable endpoint is `/delete_task.php`, suggesting attackers could delete arbitrary tasks or manipulate records.\n\n- **Availability Impact (A): High (H)**\n  - Exploiting this vulnerability could disrupt the application's functionality.\n  - **Reasoning:** Deleting tasks or corrupting the database could render the system unusable.\n\n---\n\n### üßÆ Summary Vector\n\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n```\n\nThis vector results in a **Base Score of 9.8 (Critical)** ‚Äî consistent with the classification provided in the CVE description.\n\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like to explore Temporal or Environmental metrics next, or if you want help scoring another CVE! üõ°Ô∏è",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability exists within a web application component that can be accessed over the internet without requiring any special network restrictions. An attacker can initiate the exploit by sending crafted HTTP requests directly to the server hosting the application, making remote exploitation feasible without physical proximity or local access."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability involves manipulating a specific parameter in a web request to trigger an SQL injection. No additional complex conditions, special configurations, or multi-step processes are necessary; the attacker only needs to craft a suitable request and send it to the server, assuming the application processes the input without proper validation."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need to have any existing user account or prior access rights within the application to exploit this flaw. The attack can be carried out by sending malicious input directly to the server, implying that no elevated privileges or prior authentication are required for successful exploitation."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attacker can initiate the attack independently by submitting malicious requests, and no action or participation from other human users is necessary. The attack does not depend on any user clicking links, opening files, or performing other interactions; it can be executed automatically by the attacker alone."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in the /delete_task.php endpoint and allows SQL injection via the 'ID' parameter. Since SQL injection can manipulate backend database queries, exploitation may affect resources beyond the immediate scope of the vulnerable web component. For example, unauthorized access or modification of unrelated database tables or escalation to administrative functions could occur, indicating a scope change. This breach of trust boundaries between the web interface and the database backend supports a 'Changed' scope classification under CVSS v3.1"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection vulnerabilities often allow attackers to extract sensitive data from the database. In this case, the manipulated 'ID' parameter could be used to craft malicious queries that retrieve user information, task details, or authentication credentials stored in the database. Since the attack is remote and the exploit is publicly available, the risk of unauthorized data disclosure is high. Therefore, the impact on confidentiality is significant, potentially leading to complete exposure of stored information"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "By injecting arbitrary SQL commands, an attacker could alter or delete records in the database, such as modifying task entries or removing user data. This undermines the integrity of the application‚Äôs data and could result in corrupted task lists or unauthorized changes to user accounts. The ability to tamper with backend data through a web-facing endpoint represents a high integrity impact, as it compromises the trustworthiness and accuracy of the system‚Äôs information"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection can be leveraged to execute commands that disrupt database operations, such as dropping tables or locking resources. In this case, targeting the /delete_task.php endpoint could allow an attacker to delete critical data or overload the database with expensive queries, leading to performance degradation or denial of service. Given the remote exploitability and potential for service disruption, the availability impact is substantial and could render the application unusable"
