      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible PHP script within the administrative interface of the application. Because the attack involves manipulating a URL parameter ('fromdate') and the exploit can be triggered remotely, the attacker does not need physical access or proximity to the target system. The attacker can initiate the exploit from any location with internet connectivity, provided the vulnerable endpoint is exposed to the public. This context allows exploitation without direct interaction with the host environment, relying solely on HTTP requests to the affected script"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation method involves injecting malicious SQL statements through a query parameter in a web request. There is no indication that the attacker must bypass any additional security mechanisms such as CAPTCHA, input validation, or authentication gates before reaching the vulnerable endpoint. The vulnerability appears to be present in a default or commonly deployed configuration of the application, and the exploit has already been publicly disclosed. Therefore, the attacker does not need to manipulate environmental factors or rely on unpredictable conditions to succeed"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerable script is part of the administrative interface, but the exploit targets a parameter that can be manipulated via a direct HTTP request. There is no mention of authentication or access control mechanisms that would restrict access to the vulnerable functionality. This suggests that the attacker can reach and exploit the vulnerability without first obtaining credentials or elevated permissions within the system. The attack can be executed without prior access to the application or its administrative features"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The SQL injection occurs through direct manipulation of a URL parameter and does not require any action from a legitimate user of the system. The attacker initiates the exploit independently by crafting and sending a malicious request to the server. There is no indication that a user must click a link, open a file, or perform any other action to facilitate the attack. The compromise is fully automated from the attacker's side and does not depend on user behavior"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a specific PHP file within the admin module of the Online Birth Certificate System. Since the SQL injection occurs through a parameter ('fromdate') and targets the backend database, the impact remains confined to the same security authority—the web application and its database. There is no indication that exploitation would affect other components outside this boundary, such as the operating system or external services. Therefore, the scope is considered unchanged, as the vulnerable and impacted components are within the same trust domain"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection vulnerabilities often allow attackers to execute arbitrary queries on the backend database. In this case, the attacker could potentially retrieve sensitive birth certificate records, including personal identifiers, dates of birth, and parental information. Since the attack is remote and targets an administrative reporting function, it likely has access to a broad dataset. This unauthorized data exposure poses a significant threat to confidentiality, especially if the database lacks granular access controls or encryption"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Beyond data retrieval, SQL injection can enable attackers to modify or delete records in the database. In the context of a birth certificate system, this could mean altering official birth records, falsifying dates, or corrupting identity data. Such tampering undermines the trustworthiness of the system and could have legal and administrative consequences. The ability to manipulate core data through unsanitized input reflects a high integrity impact, especially if the attacker gains write privileges via crafted queries"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While SQL injection primarily threatens data confidentiality and integrity, it can also affect availability. An attacker could craft queries that lock tables, drop critical schema elements, or induce resource exhaustion through heavy queries. These actions could render the system partially or fully unavailable to legitimate users. Given that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable and affects an administrative reporting endpoint, it could be leveraged to disrupt backend operations, leading to performance degradation or denial of service"
