        "content": "Here’s a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4177**, based on the official definitions and the vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Attack Vector (AV): **Network (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by unauthenticated attackers. Since the plugin is part of a WordPress site, which typically exposes functionality over the internet, the attacker does not need physical or local access.\n- **Impact**: This is the most remote vector, increasing the severity.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ Attack Complexity (AC): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: No special conditions or environmental factors are required. The lack of a capability check means the attacker can directly invoke the vulnerable function without needing to bypass additional defenses or gather complex information.\n- **Impact**: Straightforward exploitation increases severity.\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 Privileges Required (PR): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated or possess any privileges. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to delete arbitrary users.\n- **Impact**: No barrier to entry makes this highly severe.\n\n---\n\n### 👤 User Interaction (UI): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: Exploitation does not require any action from a legitimate user. The attacker can trigger the vulnerability independently.\n- **Impact**: No dependency on user behavior increases severity.\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 Scope (S): **Unchanged (U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerable component (Flynax Bridge plugin) and the impacted component (WordPress user data) are within the same security scope. There’s no indication that the vulnerability affects other components outside the plugin’s domain.\n- **Impact**: No scope change keeps the score within the same boundary.\n\n---\n\n### 🔒 Confidentiality Impact (C): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability does not expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access to data. It strictly involves deletion, not disclosure.\n- **Impact**: No confidentiality loss.\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 Integrity Impact (I): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The ability to delete arbitrary users affects the integrity of the system. While it doesn’t allow modification of data, it undermines trust in user management and system consistency.\n- **Impact**: Partial integrity loss.\n\n---\n\n### 🚫 Availability Impact (A): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability does not affect system availability. It doesn’t crash the system or make services unavailable—it targets user records.\n- **Impact**: No availability loss.\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 Final Vector String\n`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N`\n\nThis results in a **Base Score of 5.3 (Medium)** [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4177).\n\nLet me know if you’d like help calculating Temporal or Environmental scores—or if you want to compare this with similar vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n> [0] [CVE-2025-4177 - NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4177)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a WordPress plugin and can be exploited by sending crafted requests to the affected site. Since the deleteUser() function lacks a capability check, an attacker does not need to be physically present or have access to the local system. Exploitation can occur remotely over standard web protocols, such as HTTP or HTTPS, by interacting with the exposed plugin endpoint. This means the attacker can initiate the exploit from any location with internet access, targeting publicly accessible WordPress installations that use the vulnerable plugin"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "There are no indications of environmental dependencies or special configurations required for exploitation. The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in a specific function, which implies that the exploit is straightforward and does not rely on race conditions, timing issues, or specific system states. The attacker only needs to identify a target running the vulnerable plugin version and issue a request that triggers the deleteUser() function. No additional setup or circumvention of defenses is necessary beyond locating a vulnerable instance"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows for unauthorized deletion of users, which means the attacker does not need to authenticate or possess any level of access to the WordPress site. The flaw is in a function that should be protected by access controls but is not, enabling any external actor to invoke it without prior login or elevated permissions. This lack of access control means the attacker can operate without having any legitimate credentials or roles within the system"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploit does not require any action from a legitimate user of the system. The attacker can independently send a request to the vulnerable endpoint and trigger the deletion of arbitrary users. There is no need for a victim to click a link, open a file, or perform any other interaction that would facilitate the attack. The compromise is entirely driven by the attacker’s actions and does not depend on user behavior or cooperation"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in the Flynax Bridge plugin affects the deleteUser() function, which allows unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary users. This action directly impacts user accounts managed by WordPress, which are outside the plugin’s immediate security scope. Since WordPress core handles user authentication and authorization, the plugin’s failure to enforce capability checks crosses a security boundary, resulting in a scope change. The plugin’s flaw enables manipulation of resources governed by a different security authority, violating the principle of least privilege and expanding the impact beyond its own domain"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "While the vulnerability primarily enables deletion of users, it does not directly expose or disclose sensitive data such as passwords, emails, or personal information. However, indirect confidentiality risks may arise if deleted users lose access to private content or if administrative accounts are removed, potentially weakening access controls. Still, the vulnerability does not inherently allow attackers to read or extract confidential information, so the confidentiality impact is likely low or none unless combined with other flaws"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The ability to delete arbitrary users without authentication constitutes a significant integrity violation. User records are critical components of the system’s data integrity, and unauthorized deletion alters the expected state of the system. This could lead to loss of audit trails, disruption of user-generated content, and corruption of relational data tied to user accounts. The absence of a capability check undermines trust in the system’s ability to preserve accurate and authorized data, making the integrity impact high"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Deleting users—especially administrative or service accounts—can disrupt access to the WordPress site and its functionality. If key users are removed, site management may be impaired, and content moderation or publishing workflows could be halted. While the plugin itself may remain operational, the broader system availability is affected due to the loss of essential user roles. This results in partial denial of service and degraded performance, indicating a moderate to high availability impact depending on the roles targeted"
