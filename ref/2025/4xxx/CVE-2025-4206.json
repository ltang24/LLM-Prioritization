Here's a CVSS v3.1 Base Score analysis for **CVE-2025-4206**, with clear reasoning based on the vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### üîê CVSS v3.1 Base Metric Analysis\n\n| Metric                    | Value       | Justification |\n|--------------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)**   | **Network** | Exploitation occurs via WordPress admin dashboard, accessible remotely by authenticated users‚Äîthus, the attack can be launched over a network. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low**     | No special conditions are required. Once authenticated with Administrator privileges, the attacker can exploit the vulnerable functions directly. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **High** | Only users with Administrator-level access (or higher) can perform the exploit, as stated in the advisory. This implies significant privileges are needed. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None**    | The attacker does not need assistance from another user. Once logged in as an admin, they can delete files autonomously. |\n| **Scope (S)**            | **Changed** | The vulnerability allows the attacker to delete arbitrary files, including those outside the plugin's domain (e.g., `wp-config.php`). This alters the scope of impact beyond the plugin itself. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)**  | **High**    | Deleting sensitive config files (like `wp-config.php`) may expose database credentials or lead to other indirect confidentiality breaches. |\n| **Integrity (I)**        | **High**    | Arbitrary file deletion compromises trust in system files and application behavior, severely impacting integrity. |\n| **Availability (A)**     | **High**    | Deleting critical files can make the application or server unusable, resulting in total service disruption. |\n\n---\n\n### üßÆ Final Base Score Estimation\n\nBased on the selected metrics above, the calculated CVSS v3.1 Base Score would be **8.8 (High)**.\n\nThis score reflects the serious risk posed when an attacker with elevated privileges can deliberately delete essential files, potentially enabling further compromise such as remote code execution.\n\nWould you like to convert this into CVSS vector string format or explore Temporal/Environmental metrics too?",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a WordPress plugin and is exploitable through administrative functions exposed via the WordPress dashboard. This means the attacker must have access to the web-based administrative interface of the WordPress site, which is typically reachable over the internet. The exploitation does not require physical proximity or access to the underlying server directly, as the vulnerable functions are triggered through HTTP requests to the plugin's endpoints. Therefore, the attacker can initiate the exploit remotely, provided they have the necessary credentials and access to the WordPress admin panel."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploit does not depend on any unusual or unpredictable environmental conditions. The vulnerable functions are directly accessible once the attacker is authenticated with sufficient privileges. There are no indications of required race conditions, timing dependencies, or specific configurations beyond the default plugin installation. The attacker simply needs to invoke the affected functions with crafted input that bypasses file path validation. This straightforward execution path implies that the exploit is not hindered by external factors or complex setup requirements."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be logged into the WordPress site with an account that has administrative capabilities. These capabilities include access to plugin management and the ability to trigger export and import operations. The vulnerability is not accessible to users with lower privilege levels such as subscribers or contributors, as they lack access to the affected functions. Therefore, exploitation is contingent upon the attacker already possessing elevated permissions within the WordPress environment."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not require any action from another user. Once the attacker is authenticated with the necessary privileges, they can directly invoke the vulnerable functions without needing a victim to click a link, open a file, or perform any other interaction. The attack is fully self-contained and does not rely on social engineering or user behavior to succeed. This means the compromise can occur without any involvement from other users of the system."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker with Administrator-level access to delete arbitrary files on the server, but the impact remains confined to the WordPress environment. Although critical files like wp-config.php can be deleted, this does not inherently affect components outside the WordPress security scope, such as the underlying operating system or unrelated services. Therefore, the scope is considered 'Unchanged' under CVSS v3.1, as the exploitation does not cross security boundaries or affect other components beyond the vulnerable plugin"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "Deleting configuration files such as wp-config.php can indirectly compromise confidentiality by enabling remote code execution or exposing sensitive database credentials. Once such files are removed, attackers may gain unauthorized access to protected data or reconfigure the system to leak information. Although the vulnerability does not directly read or exfiltrate data, the resulting system compromise can lead to high confidentiality impact due to potential data exposure and unauthorized access"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The ability to delete arbitrary files poses a significant threat to data integrity. Attackers can remove or tamper with critical files that govern application behavior, authentication, or data storage. For example, deleting plugin files or core WordPress components can corrupt the system‚Äôs operational logic or allow malicious reconfiguration. This undermines the trustworthiness and correctness of the system, qualifying as a high integrity impact under CVSS v3.1"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Arbitrary file deletion can severely disrupt the availability of the WordPress site. Removing essential files like wp-config.php or index.php can render the site completely inaccessible, resulting in denial of service. Even partial deletions may degrade performance or cause intermittent failures. Because the vulnerability enables targeted removal of critical resources, the availability impact is considered high, as it can lead to prolonged service outages or total application failure"
