Let‚Äôs break down CVE-2025-4781 using the **CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics**, with detailed reasoning based on the official definitions and the vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### üîç CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Analysis for CVE-2025-4781\n\n| **Metric**               | **Value**       | **Rationale**                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)**  | **Network (N)** | The attack can be launched remotely via the `/forgot-password.php` endpoint, indicating network-level exploitation. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)**    | SQL injection via direct input manipulation generally doesn‚Äôt require special conditions or advanced preparation. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None (N)**  | The attacker doesn‚Äôt need to be authenticated‚Äîexploitable by any remote user via public form inputs. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)**   | The exploit occurs without the need for another user‚Äôs action; the server-side logic is directly affected. |\n| **Scope (S)**           | **Unchanged (U)** | The vulnerability seems confined to the affected component. No indication of impact beyond its security scope. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)** | **High (H)**    | Successful SQL injection can expose sensitive user data such as emails or contact numbers, compromising confidentiality. |\n| **Integrity (I)**       | **High (H)**    | The attacker could manipulate backend database values‚Äîdamaging data integrity. |\n| **Availability (A)**    | **High (H)**    | SQL injection could allow deletion or corruption of data, potentially disrupting system availability. |\n\n---\n\n### üßÆ Overall CVSS v3.1 Base Score (Estimated): **9.8 (Critical)**\nBased on the above metrics, this vulnerability likely scores as **Critical**, primarily due to:\n- Full remote exploitability\n- No prerequisites like privileges or user interaction\n- Severe impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability\n\nIf you‚Äôd like, I can help draft a mitigation strategy or compare it with similar CVEs.

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible endpoint (/forgot-password.php), which processes user-supplied input via the 'email/contactno' parameter. Because this endpoint is part of a public-facing web application, an attacker can exploit it from any location with internet access, without needing to be physically near the system or connected to the same network. The SQL injection flaw allows malicious payloads to be sent directly through HTTP requests, making the exploitation feasible from remote environments such as a browser or automated script"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation of this vulnerability does not appear to require any special conditions beyond the presence of the vulnerable endpoint. There is no indication of required system misconfigurations, race conditions, or environmental factors that would complicate the attack. The attacker simply needs to craft a malicious input string targeting the 'email/contactno' parameter to trigger the SQL injection. This suggests that the conditions necessary for exploitation are minimal and predictable, relying solely on the application's failure to sanitize input"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerable functionality is part of the password recovery mechanism, which is typically accessible to unauthenticated users. Since the attack targets a public endpoint and involves injecting SQL through a form field, it can be executed without logging into the system or possessing any user credentials. The attacker does not need elevated permissions or access to restricted areas of the application to perform the exploit, making it viable from a completely external standpoint"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attack targets a backend vulnerability triggered by submitting crafted input to a form field. There is no indication that a legitimate user must perform any action such as clicking a link, opening a file, or interacting with the attacker‚Äôs payload. The attacker initiates and completes the exploit independently by sending a malicious request to the server. Therefore, the success of the attack does not depend on any participation or behavior from other users of the system"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The CVSS v3.1 vector for CVE-2025-4781 specifies Scope as 'Unchanged', indicating that exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability in /forgot-password.php does not result in impacts that extend beyond the vulnerable component‚Äôs security authority. The attack affects only the PHPGurukul Park Ticketing Management System itself and does not compromise other components or systems outside its defined security boundary. This aligns with the CVSS definition where the impacted component is the same as the vulnerable component, and no privilege escalation or lateral movement occurs"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVSS vector assigns a 'Low' rating to Confidentiality Impact, meaning that while sensitive data may be exposed, the scope of disclosure is limited. The SQL injection vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially retrieving user credentials, contact information, or other stored data. However, the lack of evidence for full database dumps or access to highly sensitive system-level data suggests that the breach is partial and does not result in total loss of confidentiality"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Integrity Impact is rated 'Low', which implies that attackers may be able to alter or delete some data, but the extent of such modifications is constrained. Through SQL injection, unauthorized changes to user records or ticketing data could occur. However, there is no indication that core system files, configurations, or administrative controls can be compromised. The vulnerability does not enable arbitrary code execution or systemic corruption, keeping the integrity impact within a limited scope"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Availability Impact is also rated 'Low', indicating that while the vulnerability could lead to some disruption, it does not render the system entirely unavailable. SQL injection attacks may result in database errors, slowdowns, or temporary denial of service if queries are malformed or resource-intensive. Nonetheless, there is no evidence of persistent service outages, resource exhaustion, or system crashes. The component remains largely operational, albeit with degraded performance under attack conditions"
