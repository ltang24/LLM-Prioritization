      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to initiate exploitation over a network connection without requiring physical access or local system interaction. Since the attack can be performed remotely by sending specially crafted commands to the FTP server, the attacker does not need to be physically close or have direct access to the system. The attack leverages the server's handling of remote commands, making it accessible over the network interface, which broadens the potential attack surface to any system capable of reaching the server via its network services."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability involves sending a specifically crafted command to the server's QUOTE command handler, which processes input data without sufficient validation. The attacker must understand the protocol and the specific command structure, but no additional complex conditions or configurations are necessary beyond establishing a network connection and transmitting the malicious payload. The attack does not depend on timing, specific system states, or other environmental factors; it relies solely on the server processing untrusted input in a vulnerable manner, making the exploitation straightforward once the attacker can reach the service."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs the ability to connect to the FTP server and send commands that the server will process. Typically, this does not require any authentication or elevated permissions because the attacker can operate as a client issuing commands to the server. The attacker does not need to have any prior privileges on the system or be an authenticated user; the attack exploits the server's command handling mechanism directly, which is accessible to any remote client connecting to the service."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not require any action or participation from legitimate users of the system or any human intervention beyond the attacker initiating the malicious connection. The attacker can send the crafted command directly to the server without convincing or prompting a user to perform specific actions. The vulnerability is triggered solely by the server processing the malicious input, meaning no additional user involvement is necessary for the attack to succeed."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The CVSS v3.1 vector for CVE-2025-4184 indicates Scope: Unchanged [[0]](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2025-4184/). This means the buffer overflow vulnerability in the QUOTE command handler of PCMan FTP Server 2.0.7 does not cross security boundaries or affect components outside its own security authority. The exploit remains confined to the FTP server process and does not compromise other system components or services. Therefore, the impact is limited to the vulnerable component itself, without cascading effects on external resources or authorization domains"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVSS vector specifies Confidentiality Impact: Low [[0]](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2025-4184/). This suggests that while the buffer overflow could potentially allow unauthorized access to some data, the extent of exposure is limited. The attacker may be able to read memory contents or access sensitive information stored in the process space of the FTP server, but not system-wide secrets or user credentials. The vulnerability does not inherently enable full data exfiltration or access to encrypted or privileged information, hence the partial impact rating"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Integrity Impact is rated Low [[0]](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2025-4184/), indicating that exploitation may allow limited modification of data within the FTP server’s memory space. An attacker could potentially alter control flow or overwrite specific variables, but the vulnerability does not facilitate broad or persistent tampering with system files, configurations, or user data. The buffer overflow may corrupt transient data or cause unintended behavior, but it does not provide mechanisms for sustained or targeted integrity violations across the system"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Availability Impact is also rated Low [[0]](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2025-4184/). The buffer overflow could lead to a crash or denial of service of the FTP server, disrupting its ability to handle client requests. However, the impact is localized to the service itself and does not extend to the operating system or other services. The vulnerability does not consume excessive resources or cause prolonged outages, and recovery may be possible through service restart. Thus, the degradation is limited in scope and duration"
