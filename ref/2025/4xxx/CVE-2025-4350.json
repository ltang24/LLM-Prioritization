        "content": "Here is a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4350**, based on the provided vulnerability description and the official CVSS definitions:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**  \n- **Reasoning**:  \n  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as stated in the description (\"The attack can be initiated remotely\"). This means the attacker does not need physical or local access to the device, and the attack can be carried out over a network.  \n  - **Value**: **Network (N)**\n\n---\n\n### **2. Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**  \n- **Reasoning**:  \n  The description does not mention any specific conditions or prerequisites that would make exploitation more difficult. Command injection vulnerabilities typically require minimal effort to exploit once the vulnerable parameter (in this case, `host`) is identified. There are no indications of mitigations like randomization or additional environmental factors that would increase complexity.  \n  - **Value**: **Low (L)**\n\n---\n\n### **3. Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**  \n- **Reasoning**:  \n  The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication or elevated privileges. The attacker can directly manipulate the `host` parameter in the `wake_on_lan` function remotely. This implies no privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.  \n  - **Value**: **None (N)**\n\n---\n\n### **4. User Interaction (UI): None (N)**  \n- **Reasoning**:  \n  There is no indication in the description that user interaction is required for exploitation. The attacker can directly exploit the vulnerability without requiring a user to perform any action (e.g., clicking a link or opening a file).  \n  - **Value**: **None (N)**\n\n---\n\n### **5. Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**  \n- **Reasoning**:  \n  The vulnerability affects the `wake_on_lan` function within the D-Link DIR-600L router. There is no evidence that exploitation of this vulnerability impacts other components or resources outside the security scope of the vulnerable component. The impact is confined to the router itself.  \n  - **Value**: **Unchanged (U)**\n\n---\n\n### **6. Confidentiality Impact (C): High (H)**  \n- **Reasoning**:  \n  Command injection vulnerabilities often allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the system. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information stored on the router, such as configuration files, credentials, or network traffic data.  \n  - **Value**: **High (H)**\n\n---\n\n### **7. Integrity Impact (I): High (H)**  \n- **Reasoning**:  \n  Successful exploitation of the command injection vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, potentially modifying system files, configurations, or other critical data. This compromises the integrity of the device.  \n  - **Value**: **High (H)**\n\n---\n\n### **8. Availability Impact (A): High (H)**  \n- **Reasoning**:  \n  Arbitrary command execution could be used to disrupt the router's functionality, such as by deleting critical files, overloading the system, or shutting down services. This would render the device unavailable to legitimate users.  \n  - **Value**: **High (H)**\n\n---\n\n### **CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation**  \nUsing the CVSS v3.1 formula and the selected metrics:\n\n- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) = 0.85  \n- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) = 0.77  \n- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) = 0.85  \n- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) = 0.85  \n- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  \n- **Confidentiality Impact (C):** High (H) = 0.56  \n- **Integrity Impact (I):** High (H) = 0.56  \n- **Availability Impact (A):** High (H) = 0.56  \n\n**Base Score = 9.8 (Critical)**  \nThe score is calculated as follows:  \n\\[\n\\text{Impact Subscore} = 6.42 \\times (1 - (1 - C) \\times (1 - I) \\times (1 - A)) = 6.42 \\times (1 - (1 - 0.56)^3) = 6.42 \\times 0.857 = 5.5\n\\]  \n\\[\n\\text{Exploitability Subscore} = 8.22 \\times AV \\times AC \\times PR \\times UI = 8.22 \\times 0.85 \\times 0.77 \\times 0.85 \\times 0.85 = 4.59\n\\]  \n\\[\n\\text{Base Score} = \\text{Impact Subscore} + \\text{Exploitability Subscore} = 5.5 + 4.59 = 9.8\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Summary**  \n| **Metric**               | **Value**       |  \n|---------------------------|-----------------|  \n| **Attack Vector (AV)**    | Network (N)     |  \n| **Attack Complexity (AC)**| Low (L)         |  \n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | None (N)      |  \n| **User Interaction (UI)** | None (N)        |  \n| **Scope (S)**             | Unchanged (U)   |  \n| **Confidentiality (C)**   | High (H)        |  \n| **Integrity (I)**         | High (H)        |  \n| **Availability (A)**      | High (H)        |  \n| **Base Score**            | **9.8 (Critical)** |",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in the wake_on_lan function of the D-Link DIR-600L router, and exploitation is possible through manipulation of the 'host' argument. Since the attack can be initiated remotely, it implies that the attacker does not need physical access to the device and can target it over a network interface, such as through HTTP requests to the router's web management interface. This means the attacker can exploit the flaw from a distant location, provided the device is exposed to the internet or accessible within a reachable network segment"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation involves injecting commands via a parameter in a known function, suggesting that the attacker does not need to bypass any additional security mechanisms or rely on unpredictable environmental factors. There is no indication of required race conditions, timing constraints, or specific hardware configurations. The vulnerable function appears to process user-supplied input directly, making the attack straightforward once the attacker identifies the endpoint and the injection vector"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The description does not mention any need for authentication or elevated access to exploit the vulnerability. If the wake_on_lan function is exposed to unauthenticated users, then the attacker can perform the injection without logging into the device or possessing any administrative credentials. This implies that the attacker can exploit the flaw without first gaining access to the system through legitimate means"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "There is no indication that a legitimate user must perform any action for the vulnerability to be exploited. The attacker can directly send crafted input to the vulnerable function, and the system will process it without requiring a user to click a link, open a file, or otherwise assist in the attack. This suggests that the compromise can occur entirely through attacker-controlled actions"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "This vulnerability impacts the specific function wake_on_lan within the D-Link DIR-600L router, which is a network device component. Since the attack can be initiated remotely and exploits a command injection flaw, it has the potential to affect the device's core operations. However, it does not inherently extend beyond the device itself to other components or systems unless further exploited. Therefore, the scope is limited primarily to the affected device, with possible indirect impacts if the device is part of a larger network infrastructure."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability involves command injection via manipulation of the wake_on_lan argument, which could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. While this could lead to information disclosure if commands are used to access or exfiltrate sensitive data, the primary impact is on command execution rather than direct data access. The confidentiality of stored or transmitted data is not explicitly compromised unless the attacker leverages command injection to access or extract sensitive information, which is not directly indicated. Thus, confidentiality impact is limited to potential indirect disclosure through command execution."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The command injection vulnerability enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device, which could modify system configurations, alter device behavior, or corrupt system files. This directly impacts the integrity of the device's software and operational state. By manipulating commands, an attacker could introduce malicious modifications, compromise device integrity, or disable security features. Therefore, the integrity of the device's system and its configurations is significantly at risk due to this vulnerability."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Exploiting the command injection could lead to resource exhaustion, system crashes, or denial of service if malicious commands disrupt normal operation or consume excessive resources. Since the vulnerability allows remote initiation and manipulation of system commands, it can be used to impair device availability, causing service disruptions or rendering the device inoperable. Consequently, the vulnerability poses a substantial threat to the availability of the affected router, potentially leading to service outages."
