Here's a CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4754**, which involves **Insufficient Session Expiration** in `ash_authentication_phoenix` allowing **Session Hijacking** [[0]](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f7gq-h8jv-h3cq) [[1]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4754):\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Breakdown\n\n| Metric | Value | Reasoning |\n|--------|-------|-----------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)** | **Network (N)** | Exploitation occurs over the network, as session tokens can be intercepted or reused remotely (e.g., via XSS, MITM, or stolen devices) [[0]](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f7gq-h8jv-h3cq). |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)** | No special conditions are required beyond obtaining a valid session token. The vulnerability stems from failure to revoke sessions on logout [[0]](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f7gq-h8jv-h3cq). |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None (N)** | Attackers do not need prior access to the system. They only need a valid session token, which could be obtained externally [[0]](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f7gq-h8jv-h3cq). |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **Required (R)** | A user must log in and then log out, leaving the session token active. The attacker exploits this post-logout state [[0]](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f7gq-h8jv-h3cq). |\n| **Scope (S)** | **Unchanged (U)** | The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the session management system). No cross-boundary impact is observed. |\n| **Confidentiality Impact (C)** | **Low (L)** | Hijacked sessions may expose user data, but not system-wide secrets or admin-level access [[0]](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f7gq-h8jv-h3cq). |\n| **Integrity Impact (I)** | **Low (L)** | Attackers may impersonate users and perform limited actions, but cannot modify system-level data or configurations. |\n| **Availability Impact (A)** | **None (N)** | The vulnerability does not affect system availability. It allows unauthorized access but does not disrupt services. |\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 CVSS v3.1 Base Score: **4.3 (Medium)**  \nThis score reflects a moderate risk due to session hijacking potential, but limited impact on system integrity and availability.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help calculating the Temporal or Environmental scores too!\n\n\n\n> [0] [ash_authentication_phoenix has Insufficient Session Expiration · CVE ...](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f7gq-h8jv-h3cq)\n>\n> [1] [NVD - CVE-2025-4754](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4754)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability arises from insufficient session expiration in a web authentication framework, specifically within the controller logic of ash_authentication_phoenix. Exploitation involves session hijacking, which typically occurs when an attacker can intercept or reuse a valid session token. Since the vulnerability is tied to session management in a web application, an attacker can exploit it remotely by leveraging access to the application over the internet or a network. No physical proximity or local access to the system is required, as the session tokens are transmitted via HTTP requests and responses"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The conditions necessary for exploitation are relatively straightforward and do not depend on external or unpredictable factors. The vulnerability stems from the failure to revoke or expire sessions upon logout, meaning that once a session token is obtained—whether through interception, theft, or reuse—it remains valid. There are no special configurations, timing constraints, or environmental dependencies that complicate exploitation. The attacker only needs access to a valid session token, which could be acquired through common techniques like phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, or insecure storage"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker does not need to have any prior authenticated access to the system. The flaw allows session hijacking purely through possession of a valid session token, which can be obtained without logging into the system. This means the attacker can be entirely unauthenticated and still compromise a user's session if they manage to acquire the token. The vulnerability does not require the attacker to have any elevated permissions or roles within the application"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "Exploitation of this vulnerability does not require any direct action from a legitimate user at the time of compromise. The vulnerability is passive in nature—once a session token is obtained, the attacker can reuse it without needing the user to click a link, open a file, or perform any other interaction. However, the initial acquisition of the session token may involve user interaction, such as falling for a phishing attempt or using an insecure network, but these are not part of the exploitation mechanics of the vulnerability itself"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability pertains to session management within the ash_authentication_phoenix component, specifically affecting its own session handling mechanisms. Since session hijacking could allow an attacker to impersonate users and access resources beyond the immediate session, it potentially impacts other components or services that rely on the compromised session. Therefore, exploitation could cross security boundaries, affecting resources outside the initial component's scope, especially if session tokens are used across multiple services or modules."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The insufficient session expiration vulnerability enables attackers to hijack active sessions, potentially granting unauthorized access to user data and sensitive information managed by the component. This can lead to disclosure of confidential data such as personal information, credentials, or other protected resources stored within or accessible through the session, thereby compromising confidentiality."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "While the primary concern is unauthorized access, session hijacking can also enable attackers to modify data or settings within the affected application, such as changing user details or manipulating session-related information. However, the core issue is not directly about data modification but about impersonation; thus, the impact on data integrity is indirect but still significant if attackers alter session states or application data during their access."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "This vulnerability can lead to service disruption if attackers repeatedly hijack sessions or cause session exhaustion, resulting in degraded service performance or denial of access for legitimate users. Additionally, malicious session activities might overload system resources or cause instability, impacting the availability of the authentication service and related functionalities."
