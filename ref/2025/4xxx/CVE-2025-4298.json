        "content": "Here’s a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4298**, based on the official definitions and the vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Attack Vector (AV): **Network (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the `/goform/setcfm` endpoint, indicating that the attacker does not need physical or local access.\n- **Impact**: This is the most remote vector, increasing the severity.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ Attack Complexity (AC): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The description does not mention any special conditions or environmental factors that must exist beyond the attacker’s control. Buffer overflows typically require straightforward input manipulation.\n- **Impact**: Low complexity means the attack is easily reproducible.\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 Privileges Required (PR): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attack can be initiated remotely without authentication or prior access, suggesting no privileges are needed.\n- **Impact**: This significantly increases the severity.\n\n---\n\n### 👤 User Interaction (UI): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: There is no indication that a user must perform any action (e.g., clicking a link or opening a file) for the exploit to succeed.\n- **Impact**: No user interaction makes the vulnerability more dangerous.\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 Scope (S): **Unchanged (U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The buffer overflow affects the same component (formSetCfm in `/goform/setcfm`) and does not appear to impact other components or security authorities.\n- **Impact**: The effects are contained within the vulnerable component.\n\n---\n\n### 🔒 Confidentiality Impact (C): **High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Buffer overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution, which may allow attackers to access sensitive data.\n- **Impact**: High risk to confidentiality.\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 Integrity Impact (I): **High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Arbitrary code execution can allow modification of system files or data, compromising integrity.\n- **Impact**: High risk to data trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n### 🚫 Availability Impact (A): **High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Buffer overflows can crash services or systems, leading to denial of service.\n- **Impact**: High risk to system availability.\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 Final CVSS v3.1 Vector:  \n**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**  \n**Base Score: 9.8 (Critical)** [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4298)\n\nLet me know if you’d like help comparing this to CVSS v4.0 or calculating temporal/environmental scores!\n\n\n\n> [0] [NVD - CVE-2025-4298](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4298)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible endpoint (/goform/setcfm) of the Tenda AC1206 router firmware. Since the attack can be initiated remotely, exploitation does not require physical proximity or access to the local network. An attacker can target the device over the internet or any network where the device is exposed, making the exploitation feasible from a distant location without direct access to the hardware or local environment"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The buffer overflow is triggered through manipulation of the formSetCfm function, which suggests that the exploit does not depend on rare or unpredictable conditions. There is no indication of required system states, race conditions, or specific environmental configurations that must be present for the attack to succeed. The public availability of the exploit further implies that the steps to reproduce the vulnerability are straightforward and do not rely on complex or fragile prerequisites"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The description does not mention any need for authentication or prior access to the device’s administrative interface. The fact that the attack can be initiated remotely and the exploit is publicly available suggests that the attacker does not need to be logged in or possess elevated permissions on the device. This implies that the vulnerable endpoint is exposed to unauthenticated users, allowing exploitation without any prior access rights"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "There is no indication that a legitimate user must perform any action for the vulnerability to be exploited. The buffer overflow occurs through direct manipulation of a web endpoint, which can be triggered by the attacker alone. This means the exploit does not rely on a user clicking a link, opening a file, or performing any other interaction that would facilitate the compromise"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The CVSS v3.1 vector for CVE-2025-4298 indicates Scope: Unchanged (S:U), meaning the impact is confined to the vulnerable component itself. The buffer overflow occurs in the formSetCfm function of the Tenda AC1206 firmware, and there is no evidence that exploitation affects other components or crosses security boundaries. The vulnerability does not appear to escalate privileges or compromise external systems, so the security scope remains within the original component"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is rated High for Confidentiality Impact (C:H), suggesting that successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information managed by the Tenda AC1206 device. Buffer overflows often allow attackers to read memory contents beyond intended boundaries, potentially exposing configuration data, credentials, or other private information stored in the device’s memory. Since the attack is remote and requires no user interaction, the risk of data disclosure is significant"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "This vulnerability also scores High for Integrity Impact (I:H), indicating that an attacker could modify or corrupt data within the affected component. Buffer overflows can enable arbitrary code execution, which may allow attackers to alter system settings, firmware parameters, or stored data. Such unauthorized modifications compromise the trustworthiness of the device’s operations and could lead to persistent tampering or installation of malicious firmware"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVSS v3.1 rating of High for Availability Impact (A:H) reflects the potential for complete disruption of the device’s functionality. Buffer overflows can crash services, consume system resources, or render the device inoperable. In this case, remote exploitation of the formSetCfm function could lead to denial-of-service conditions, making the router unavailable to users and disrupting network connectivity until manual intervention or firmware recovery is performed"
