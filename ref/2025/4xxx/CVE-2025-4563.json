        "content": "Here’s a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4563**, based on the official definitions and the vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 CVSS Vector: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L`  \n**Base Score: 2.7 (Low)** [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4563)\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 Metric Breakdown & Justification\n\n| **Metric**               | **Value** | **Reasoning** |\n|--------------------------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)**   | Network (N) | Exploitation occurs via API server communication, which is accessible over the network. A compromised node can send pod creation requests remotely [[1]](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4563). |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | Low (L) | No specialized conditions or configurations are required beyond enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation feature. The flaw is in logic, not in environmental setup [[1]](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4563). |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | High (H) | The attacker must control a node, which implies high privileges within the cluster. This is not a low-bar attack [[1]](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4563). |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | None (N) | No user involvement is needed. The node acts autonomously to exploit the flaw during pod creation [[1]](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4563). |\n| **Scope (S)**            | Unchanged (U) | The impact is confined to the same security authority (the Kubernetes cluster). It doesn’t affect other systems or components outside the cluster boundary [[1]](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4563). |\n| **Confidentiality (C)**  | None (N) | The vulnerability does not expose sensitive data. It allows unauthorized resource access but doesn’t leak information [[1]](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4563). |\n| **Integrity (I)**        | None (N) | There’s no evidence of data tampering or unauthorized modification. The issue is about access, not alteration [[1]](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4563). |\n| **Availability (A)**     | Low (L) | Exploiting this could lead to resource misuse or denial of service for legitimate pods, but the impact is limited due to kubelet sanity checks that prevent pod startup [[1]](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4563). |\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Summary\n\nThis vulnerability allows a compromised node to bypass resource allocation checks during pod creation, but only under specific conditions (feature gate enabled + static pods). While it could theoretically lead to privilege escalation, practical impact is constrained by internal safeguards. Hence, the **Low severity rating of 2.7** is appropriate.\n\nIf you’d like, I can walk you through how this score compares to similar Kubernetes vulnerabilities or help you simulate different environmental scenarios.\n\n\n\n> [0] [CVE-2025-4563 - NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4563)\n>\n> [1] [CVE-2025-4563 Impact, Exploitability, and Mitigation Steps | Wiz](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4563)",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by a compromised node within the Kubernetes cluster. The attack does not require physical access or proximity, as it involves bypassing authorization checks during pod creation. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability over the network by sending specially crafted requests to the Kubernetes API server, which processes pod creation requests. This remote exploitation is facilitated by the network-based nature of Kubernetes, where nodes communicate with the API server over the network to manage resources"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability does not require any specific conditions beyond the attacker's control, other than the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate being enabled. The vulnerability arises from a flaw in the NodeRestriction admission controller, which fails to validate resource claims during pod creation. There are no additional configurations or environmental conditions that must be met for the exploit to succeed, making the attack straightforward once the attacker has control of a node"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker must have control over a node within the Kubernetes cluster to exploit this vulnerability. This means the attacker needs to have already compromised a node or have the ability to execute commands on it. The vulnerability allows the attacker to create mirror pods that access unauthorized dynamic resources, indicating that some level of privilege within the cluster is necessary to initiate the attack, but not necessarily administrative privileges"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "Exploitation of this vulnerability does not require any interaction from a human user other than the attacker. The process involves the attacker using a compromised node to create unauthorized pods, and this can be done programmatically without needing any user to perform actions such as clicking links or providing credentials. The attack is executed entirely through automated processes once the attacker has access to a node"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The scope of CVE-2025-4563 is changed because the vulnerability allows a compromised node to affect resources beyond its intended security boundary. Specifically, by bypassing dynamic resource allocation authorization checks, a node can create mirror pods that access unauthorized resources. This crosses the security boundary of the node itself, impacting other components within the Kubernetes cluster, such as resource allocation systems and potentially other nodes that rely on these resources"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The confidentiality impact of this vulnerability is high, as it allows unauthorized access to dynamic resources. By creating mirror pods, a compromised node can potentially access sensitive data or resources that it should not have access to. This unauthorized access can lead to the exposure of confidential information managed by the dynamic resources, which could include sensitive application data or configuration details"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The integrity impact is significant because the vulnerability allows a compromised node to create mirror pods that can interact with unauthorized resources. This could lead to unauthorized modifications of data or configurations within those resources. The ability to manipulate dynamic resources without proper authorization checks can result in data corruption or unauthorized changes to the system state, affecting the integrity of the Kubernetes environment"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The availability impact is moderate to high, as the creation of unauthorized mirror pods can lead to resource exhaustion or misallocation within the Kubernetes cluster. This could degrade the performance of legitimate services or even cause denial of service if critical resources are consumed by unauthorized pods. The failure to validate resource claims during pod creation can lead to unexpected resource usage patterns, impacting the overall availability of the system"
