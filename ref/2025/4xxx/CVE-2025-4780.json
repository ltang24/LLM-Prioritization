        "content": "Let's analyze **CVE-2025-4780** using the **CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics**, based on the provided description:\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 **Vulnerability Summary**\n- **Product**: PHPGurukul Park Ticketing Management System 2.0  \n- **Vulnerable File**: `/foreigner-search.php`  \n- **Vulnerability Type**: SQL Injection via `searchdata` parameter  \n- **Attack Vector**: Remote  \n- **Exploit Availability**: Public  \n- **Impact**: Not explicitly detailed, but SQL injection typically allows data exfiltration, modification, or even full system compromise depending on context.\n\n---\n\n## 🧮 CVSS v3.1 Base Score Metrics\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Attack Vector (AV):** **Network (N)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nThe vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a web request to `/foreigner-search.php`. This means the attacker does not need local or physical access to the system.\n\n> **Value**: **N (Network)**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nThere is no indication of any special conditions or requirements (e.g., race conditions, timing, or prior knowledge) to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker simply manipulates the `searchdata` parameter.\n\n> **Value**: **L (Low)**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nThe attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any privileges to exploit the vulnerability. It affects a public-facing script (`/foreigner-search.php`), and the attack is initiated remotely.\n\n> **Value**: **N (None)**\n\n---\n\n### 4. **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nNo user interaction is required. The attacker can directly send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n> **Value**: **N (None)**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nThere is no indication that the vulnerability allows the attacker to break out of the vulnerable component’s security scope. The SQL injection likely affects the same application and its database, which are under the same security authority.\n\n> **Value**: **U (Unchanged)**\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Confidentiality Impact (C):** **High (H)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nSQL injection can allow attackers to **read sensitive data** from the database (e.g., user credentials, personal data, ticketing records). Since the exploit is public and the vulnerability is rated as critical, it likely allows full data disclosure.\n\n> **Value**: **H (High)**\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Integrity Impact (I):** **High (H)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nSQL injection can also allow modification of database contents (e.g., altering ticket records, inserting malicious data). This compromises the integrity of the system.\n\n> **Value**: **H (High)**\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Availability Impact (A):** **High (H)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nIn many SQL injection cases, attackers can cause **denial of service** (e.g., by dropping tables, locking rows, or executing heavy queries). Given the critical rating and public exploit, it is reasonable to assume availability can be significantly impacted.\n\n> **Value**: **H (High)**\n\n---\n\n## 🧾 Final CVSS v3.1 Vector and Score\n\n**CVSS Vector String**:  \n`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`\n\n**Base Score**: **9.8 (Critical)**\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Summary Table\n\n| Metric                  | Value | Justification |\n|-------------------------|-------|---------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)**  | N     | Remote exploitation via HTTP |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | L  | No special conditions needed |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | N | No authentication required |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | N | No user interaction needed |\n| **Scope (S)**           | U     | No scope change indicated |\n| **Confidentiality (C)** | H     | Likely full data disclosure |\n| **Integrity (I)**       | H     | Data modification possible |\n| **Availability (A)**    | H     | Potential DoS or system impact |\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like an **Environmental** or **Temporal** score analysis as well.",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited over a network connection by an attacker who can send specially crafted requests to the server hosting the application. Since the flaw involves manipulating input parameters in a web interface accessible remotely, the attacker does not need physical access or local system privileges, making exploitation feasible through remote communication channels."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to craft specific input data that triggers the SQL injection in the targeted parameter. There are no indications of additional conditions such as bypassing authentication, complex configuration setups, or reliance on particular system states. The attacker only needs to identify the vulnerable input point and send the malicious payload, which is straightforward given the publicly disclosed exploit."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any prior access privileges or authenticated session to initiate the attack. The vulnerability exists in a publicly accessible web page, and exploitation involves sending malicious requests directly to the server. Therefore, the attacker operates without any elevated or specific user privileges, relying solely on the ability to send crafted network requests."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attack does not require any action or participation from legitimate users of the system. The attacker can perform the exploit independently by sending malicious input data through automated tools or scripts, without prompting or convincing a human user to perform specific actions or interact with the system in any way."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides within the /foreigner-search.php component of the PHPGurukul Park Ticketing Management System. Based on the CVSS vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H [[0]](https://www.security-database.com/detail.php?alert=CVE-2025-4780), the scope is marked as 'Unchanged', indicating that exploitation does not result in impacts beyond the vulnerable component’s security authority. The SQL injection affects only the database operations within the same application boundary and does not compromise other system components or services outside the ticketing system’s scope"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVSS vector indicates a 'High' confidentiality impact [[0]](https://www.security-database.com/detail.php?alert=CVE-2025-4780). SQL injection vulnerabilities often allow attackers to extract sensitive data directly from the backend database. In this case, the manipulated 'searchdata' parameter could be used to bypass access controls and retrieve personally identifiable information (PII), ticketing records, or administrative credentials. Since the attack is remote and unauthenticated, any exposed data could be accessed without prior authorization, posing a serious risk to user privacy and data protection"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVSS vector also rates integrity impact as 'High' [[0]](https://www.security-database.com/detail.php?alert=CVE-2025-4780). SQL injection can enable attackers to alter database queries, potentially allowing unauthorized modification or deletion of records. This could include tampering with ticketing data, altering user profiles, or injecting malicious content into the system. Such unauthorized changes compromise the trustworthiness of the system’s data and could lead to fraudulent transactions or operational inconsistencies"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Availability is rated 'High' in the CVSS vector [[0]](https://www.security-database.com/detail.php?alert=CVE-2025-4780), suggesting that exploitation could significantly disrupt system functionality. SQL injection attacks may be used to execute commands that lock tables, drop critical data structures, or exhaust server resources through complex queries. These actions could render the ticketing system inaccessible, degrade performance, or cause denial-of-service conditions, thereby affecting legitimate users’ ability to access services"
