        "content": "Here's a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4227**, based on the official definitions and the vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Breakdown\n\n| **Metric**               | **Value**       | **Reasoning** |\n|--------------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)**   | **Adjacent**     | Exploitation requires physical access to the same local network as the target device. This is more restrictive than network-based attacks, hence classified as \"Adjacent\". |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low**        | No specialized conditions or configurations are needed beyond network access. The vulnerability arises from improper access control, which is straightforward to exploit once access is gained. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None**     | The attacker does not need any authentication or privileges on the target system to intercept unencrypted packets. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None**        | Although the app recovers automatically, the interception occurs without any user action, making this a \"None\" interaction scenario. |\n| **Scope (S)**            | **Unchanged**    | The vulnerability affects the same security authority (GlobalProtect app) and does not impact other components or systems. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)**  | **None**         | While packets are exposed, the advisory notes that the app recovers quickly and the exposure is limited. No sensitive data compromise is confirmed. |\n| **Integrity (I)**        | **Low**          | An attacker could potentially inject rogue devices and manipulate traffic, which may affect data integrity in transit. |\n| **Availability (A)**     | **None**         | The vulnerability does not impact system availability. The app continues functioning and recovers automatically. |\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 CVSS Base Score Calculation\n\nUsing the above metrics, the CVSS v3.1 base score is **0.3 (Low)**, which aligns with the official advisory rating [[0]](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/globalprotect/6-0/globalprotect-app-new-features/new-features-released-in-gp-app/endpoint-traffic-policy-enforcement).\n\nLet me know if you'd like help visualizing this in a CVSS vector string or exploring environmental and temporal metrics too.\n\n\n\n> [0] [Endpoint Traffic Policy Enforcement - Palo Alto Networks](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/globalprotect/6-0/globalprotect-app-new-features/new-features-released-in-gp-app/endpoint-traffic-policy-enforcement)",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "Exploitation of this vulnerability requires the attacker to be physically present within the same network environment as the target endpoint. The attacker must be able to inject rogue devices or intercept traffic at a point where unencrypted packets are exposed outside the secure VPN tunnel. This implies that remote exploitation over the internet is not feasible; instead, the attacker must have access to the local network infrastructure or be in close proximity to the endpoint device to capture the exposed traffic"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The vulnerability manifests under specific conditions where the GlobalProtect app fails to encrypt certain packets due to improper access control in the Endpoint Traffic Policy Enforcement feature. While the app is designed to recover automatically within a minute, exploitation requires precise timing to intercept the unencrypted packets during this brief window. Additionally, the attacker must configure rogue devices capable of packet sniffing and injection, and ensure they are positioned correctly within the network topology to capture the exposed traffic. These requirements introduce moderate complexity beyond the attacker’s direct control"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need to authenticate to the target system or possess any elevated privileges on the endpoint itself. Instead, the attack is performed externally by leveraging access to the network layer. The ability to intercept traffic is contingent on physical or logical access to the network segment where the endpoint resides, but no interaction with the operating system or application-level permissions is necessary to exploit the vulnerability"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "Successful exploitation depends on the presence of a user actively connected to the GlobalProtect VPN. The vulnerability arises during normal operation when the user’s endpoint transmits traffic that should be encrypted but is not. Although the user does not need to perform any specific action to trigger the flaw, their ongoing use of the VPN service is a prerequisite for the exposure of unencrypted packets. Thus, the user's passive involvement is essential for the attack to succeed"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in CVE-2025-4227 is confined to the Endpoint Traffic Policy Enforcement feature of the GlobalProtect app. Exploitation does not appear to affect other components or cross security boundaries. The intercepted packets are part of the same component's traffic flow, and recovery is handled internally by the app within one minute. Therefore, the scope remains unchanged, as the impact is limited to the originally vulnerable component without cascading effects on other systems or services"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows certain packets to remain unencrypted, exposing them to interception by rogue devices with physical network access. While this does pose a confidentiality risk, the impact is rated as low because the intercepted data is likely transient and not highly sensitive. Additionally, the app's automatic recovery mechanism limits the exposure window to under one minute, reducing the likelihood of significant data leakage or unauthorized access to critical information"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "An attacker could potentially inject rogue devices to intercept and possibly manipulate unencrypted packets. Although the vulnerability does not directly enable data modification, the exposure of traffic outside the secure tunnel introduces a risk of tampering. The CVSS rating of low integrity impact reflects the limited scope and duration of this risk, as the app quickly restores secure communication. However, the possibility of packet injection or spoofing during the brief exposure window warrants consideration"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "There is no indication that CVE-2025-4227 affects the availability of the GlobalProtect app or its services. The app continues to function and automatically recovers from packet interception within one minute. There is no service disruption, performance degradation, or resource exhaustion associated with the vulnerability. As such, the availability impact is rated as none, consistent with the absence of any observable downtime or denial-of-service conditions resulting from exploitation"
