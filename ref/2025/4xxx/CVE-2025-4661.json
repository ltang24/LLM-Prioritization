Here's a detailed breakdown of the CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics for **CVE-2025-4661**, along with reasoning for each decision, based on the official CVSS v3.1 specification.\n\n---\n\n### üîç CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Analysis\n\n| **Metric**             | **Value** | **Explanation** |\n|------------------------|-----------|------------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)** | **Adjacent (A)** | Exploitation requires access to the local switch as an authenticated admin user‚Äîthis places the attacker within an internal network segment or logical adjacency, not fully local (e.g., not requiring physical access to the device). |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)** | No special conditions or circumstances are required beyond normal admin access. A straightforward path traversal technique can be used once access is gained. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **High (H)** | The attacker must have **admin-level access** to the Brocade switch CLI to exploit the vulnerability. High privileges are necessary. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)** | Exploitation does **not** require any action or interaction by another user (e.g., clicking links or opening files). The attacker can execute the path traversal independently. |\n| **Scope (S)** | **Unchanged (U)** | The impact is confined to the same security authority‚Äîthe vulnerable component (Fabric OS) and affected resources remain within its own control; there's no breach into other components or systems. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)** | **Low (L)** | The vulnerability may expose sensitive information outside the intended directory, but there‚Äôs no indication of full system data breach. A limited set of files is potentially exposed. |\n| **Integrity (I)** | **None (N)** | The vulnerability allows read access, not write or modification of data. There's no impact on integrity. |\n| **Availability (A)** | **None (N)** | The issue does not result in denial of service or loss of functionality. System availability remains unaffected. |\n\n---\n\n### üìä Resulting Score\n\nBased on these metrics, CVSS v3.1 calculates a **Base Score of 4.8 (Medium severity)**, which aligns with Broadcom‚Äôs advisory.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like help with Temporal or Environmental metrics, or a side-by-side comparison with CVSS v4.0.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability requires the attacker to have access to the Brocade Fabric OS environment, specifically with administrative privileges on the switch. This means the attacker must already be operating within the system's local context, such as through a direct console session or authenticated shell access. Exploitation cannot be performed remotely over a network without prior access, as the vulnerability involves manipulating file paths within the local file system of the switch. Therefore, the attacker must be physically or logically present within the system environment where the vulnerable component resides"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation of this vulnerability does not appear to depend on any external conditions beyond the attacker‚Äôs control. Once the attacker has administrative access, they can perform path traversal by crafting file access requests that escape the intended directory boundaries. There is no indication of required system misconfigurations, race conditions, or timing dependencies. The vulnerability is deterministic and can be triggered reliably by manipulating file paths, assuming the attacker knows the directory structure and the location of sensitive files"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The CVE explicitly states that administrative-level access is required to exploit the vulnerability. This implies that the attacker must already have elevated permissions on the Brocade switch, such as those granted to system administrators. These privileges typically allow access to system-level commands and configuration files. Without such access, the attacker would be unable to execute the necessary operations to traverse directories or read sensitive files outside the intended scope. The requirement for such high-level access significantly limits the pool of potential attackers"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "There is no indication that another user must perform any action for the vulnerability to be exploited. The attacker, once authenticated with administrative privileges, can execute the exploit independently. The path traversal technique involves direct manipulation of file paths and does not rely on tricking a user into clicking links, opening files, or performing any other interactive behavior. Therefore, the exploitation process is entirely under the attacker‚Äôs control and does not require cooperation or inadvertent participation from other users"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is confined to a local Fabric OS component where an attacker with admin privileges can access files outside the intended directory. Since exploitation requires local admin access and does not enable code execution or cross-component interaction, the impact remains within the same security boundary, not affecting other components or systems beyond the compromised device."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The path traversal allows a local admin to access and potentially disclose sensitive files stored within the device's filesystem. This could include configuration data, credentials, or other confidential information, thereby compromising the confidentiality of resources managed by the component. However, it does not inherently expose data from other systems or external resources."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability primarily enables reading of files outside the designated directories, with no indication of ability to modify or corrupt data. Since the exploit involves path traversal for disclosure rather than data modification, the integrity of the system's data remains largely unaffected, assuming no additional vulnerabilities are present to escalate privileges or alter files."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability does not directly cause service disruption, performance degradation, or resource exhaustion. It is a read-only disclosure flaw that, while potentially sensitive, does not impact the operational availability of the Brocade Fabric OS or associated network components. Therefore, the availability impact is minimal."
