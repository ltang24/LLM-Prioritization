No physical access or local account is required.                |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)**     | The exploit is publicly available and doesn‚Äôt seem to require any special conditions. Most XSS attacks are straightforward and reproducible.                      |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None (N)** | XSS can often be triggered by sending a crafted link or POST request; attackers don‚Äôt need authenticated access to the vulnerable page.                           |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **Required (R)** | A user typically must click a link or load a page containing the malicious script. This interaction is essential for triggering most XSS payloads.                |\n| **Scope (S)**          | **Unchanged (U)** | The XSS appears limited to the same component (Add User Page). No indication that other components or privileges are affected.                                     |\n| **Confidentiality (C)** | **None (N)**     | Reflected/stored XSS generally doesn‚Äôt directly expose sensitive data unless chained with another vulnerability. No specific data exposure noted here.           |\n| **Integrity (I)**       | **Low (L)**       | Attackers may inject or alter content displayed to the user (e.g., fake forms), which can lead to phishing or manipulation.                                        |\n| **Availability (A)**    | **None (N)**     | XSS typically doesn‚Äôt disrupt service operation or availability‚Äîjust affects the content in the user‚Äôs browser session.                                           |\n\n---\n\n### ‚öñÔ∏è CVSS Base Score\n\nBased on the selected values, the score would fall around **4.3 (Medium)**. The key drivers are its remote exploitability with no privileges required, balanced by the necessity of user interaction and its limited scope and impact.\n\nLet me know if you want to calculate the score with vector string or dig into Exploitability and Impact subscores too!",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited over a network, as it is related to a web-based system. This means an attacker can potentially exploit the vulnerability from anywhere with internet access, without needing physical proximity to the target system. The fact that the attack can be launched remotely indicates that the attacker does not need to be on the same local network or have physical access to the system hosting the vulnerable application"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability does not require any special conditions or configurations beyond the attacker's control. The vulnerability is in the 'Add User Page' of the application, and since it involves cross-site scripting, the attacker simply needs to craft a malicious input that the application fails to properly sanitize. There are no indications of needing to bypass additional security measures or requiring specific system states, making the exploitation straightforward once the vulnerable parameters are identified"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited without the attacker needing any prior access to the system. Since the issue is related to cross-site scripting, it typically involves injecting malicious scripts into web pages that are then executed in the context of other users' sessions. This suggests that the attacker does not need to have an account or any elevated privileges within the application to exploit the vulnerability"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "Exploitation of this vulnerability requires another user to interact with the malicious content injected by the attacker. For cross-site scripting attacks, a user must visit a page or interact with a component where the attacker's script has been injected. This means the success of the attack depends on a user performing an action, such as clicking a link or loading a page, to trigger the execution of the malicious script"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is confined to the Add User Page component and results in cross-site scripting (XSS). XSS typically affects only the vulnerable component's security scope and does not inherently compromise other system components or cross security boundaries. Therefore, the scope remains unchanged, as the exploit does not escalate privileges or affect external modules beyond the Add User Page"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "XSS vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user data, such as session tokens, cookies, or personal information displayed on the affected page. If an attacker successfully injects malicious scripts, they may exfiltrate data from users interacting with the Add User Page. However, the impact is generally limited to data visible to the victim user and does not compromise backend databases directly"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "While XSS does not directly modify server-side data, it can affect the integrity of client-side content. Malicious scripts may alter the appearance or behavior of the Add User Page, misleading users or injecting unauthorized actions. For example, attackers could forge form submissions or impersonate user actions, indirectly affecting data integrity through social engineering or unauthorized input"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "XSS attacks typically do not target system availability. They do not consume significant resources or cause service outages. However, in rare cases, injected scripts could lead to browser crashes or denial of service for individual users interacting with the page. Overall, the availability impact is minimal and localized, not affecting the broader system performance or uptime"
