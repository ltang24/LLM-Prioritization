        "content": "Let's analyze **CVE-2025-4490** using the **CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics**, based on the information provided:\n\n---\n\n### üîç **Vulnerability Summary**\n\n- **Product**: Campcodes Online Food Ordering System 1.0  \n- **Vulnerable File**: `/view-ticket-admin.php`  \n- **Vulnerability Type**: SQL Injection via `ID` parameter  \n- **Attack Vector**: Remote  \n- **Exploit Status**: Publicly disclosed and potentially weaponized  \n- **Impact**: Not explicitly stated, but SQL injection typically allows data exfiltration, modification, or even full system compromise depending on context.\n\n---\n\n## üßÆ CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Analysis\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: **Network (N)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nThe vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a web interface (`/view-ticket-admin.php`). This means the attacker does not need physical access or local/network-level access to the system.  \n‚û°Ô∏è **Value**: **N (Network)**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: **Low (L)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nThere is no indication of any special conditions or requirements for exploiting the vulnerability. SQL injection, especially in a GET or POST parameter like `ID`, is typically straightforward once discovered.  \n‚û°Ô∏è **Value**: **L (Low)**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: **None (N)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nThe attacker can exploit the vulnerability without authentication or prior access. The parameter `ID` is manipulated directly, and the attack is initiated remotely.  \n‚û°Ô∏è **Value**: **N (None)**\n\n---\n\n### 4. **User Interaction (UI)**: **None (N)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nThe attack does not require any user interaction (e.g., clicking a link, opening a file). The attacker sends a crafted request directly to the vulnerable endpoint.  \n‚û°Ô∏è **Value**: **N (None)**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Scope (S)**: **Changed (C)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nSQL injection often allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, which can affect the underlying database ‚Äî a separate component from the web application. This means the vulnerability in the web application component (PHP file) can impact the database (a different security authority).  \n‚û°Ô∏è **Value**: **C (Changed)**\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Confidentiality Impact (C)**: **High (H)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nSQL injection can allow attackers to read sensitive data from the database (e.g., user credentials, personal information, order history). This represents a **high** impact on confidentiality.  \n‚û°Ô∏è **Value**: **H (High)**\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Integrity Impact (I)**: **High (H)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nIf the attacker can modify or delete data in the database (which is common in SQL injection), this compromises the integrity of the system.  \n‚û°Ô∏è **Value**: **H (High)**\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Availability Impact (A)**: **High (H)**  \n**Reasoning**:  \nAn attacker may be able to delete or corrupt data, or even execute commands that bring down the application (e.g., dropping tables). This would result in a **high** impact on availability.  \n‚û°Ô∏è **Value**: **H (High)**\n\n---\n\n## üßæ Final CVSS v3.1 Vector and Score\n\n**Vector String**:  \n`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H`\n\n**Base Score**: **10.0 (Critical)**\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ Summary Table\n\n| Metric                     | Value | Reasoning |\n|---------------------------|--------|-----------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)**     | N (Network) | Exploitable remotely via web |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | L (Low) | No special conditions required |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | N (None) | No authentication needed |\n| **User Interaction (UI)**   | N (None) | No user interaction needed |\n| **Scope (S)**               | C (Changed) | Web app affects database (different scope) |\n| **Confidentiality (C)**     | H (High) | Potential data exfiltration |\n| **Integrity (I)**           | H (High) | Data modification possible |\n| **Availability (A)**        | H (High) | Potential for service disruption |\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need the **Temporal** or **Environmental** metrics evaluated as well.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows exploitation through remote initiation, as indicated by the ability to manipulate the 'ID' argument of a web-accessible PHP file. Attackers can craft and send malicious HTTP requests over the internet without direct access to the server or internal network. The attack surface includes public-facing components of the web application, meaning exploitation can be triggered via standard web interfaces using any browser or automated tool, entirely from outside the target environment"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploit involves injecting malicious SQL code by manipulating a URL parameter, which is a widely known and technically straightforward attack pattern. No indicators suggest that special server configurations, environment-specific variables, or timing constraints are required for success. The availability of a public proof-of-concept further demonstrates that the conditions necessary for the exploit to work are minimal and consistent across common deployments of the software"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "Because the SQL injection is performed through unauthenticated manipulation of the 'ID' argument, the attacker does not need to log into the application or possess any specific roles or permissions in the system beforehand. The vulnerable PHP file processes incoming requests without validating the identity of the requester, making it possible for attackers to access and exploit the flaw without having first gained entry into the application or system"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploit does not rely on any action performed by a legitimate user of the application, such as clicking a link, entering input, or executing content. The attacker independently sends crafted requests to the target server, and the vulnerability is triggered purely by server-side processing of the manipulated input. Therefore, no human interaction beyond the attacker‚Äôs involvement is necessary to successfully execute the attack"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in the /view-ticket-admin.php component and is triggered via SQL injection through the 'ID' parameter. Based on CVSS v3.1 vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L, the Scope is marked as 'Unchanged'. This indicates that the impact is confined to the vulnerable component itself and does not propagate to other components or cross security boundaries. The SQL injection affects the data layer of the same application without altering the behavior or privileges of other system modules"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVSS vector indicates a 'Low' impact on confidentiality. SQL injection vulnerabilities typically allow attackers to extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials, order details, or administrative information. However, the impact is considered low because the attacker may only access limited data depending on the query structure and database permissions. The lack of authentication requirements increases the risk, but the scope of data exposure appears constrained to the application's own dataset"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The integrity impact is also rated 'Low' in the CVSS vector. SQL injection can allow unauthorized modification of database records, such as altering ticket statuses or injecting malicious content. However, the extent of modification is likely limited to the affected table or query context. There is no indication of systemic corruption or compromise of broader system integrity, which keeps the rating at a low level despite the potential for targeted tampering"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Availability is rated 'Low' because while SQL injection can lead to denial-of-service conditions‚Äîsuch as crashing the database or exhausting resources through heavy queries‚Äîthe vulnerability description does not suggest such exploitation. The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated, but the impact appears limited to potential performance degradation or temporary disruption of the ticket viewing functionality, rather than full system outage"
