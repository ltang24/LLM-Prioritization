      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited over a network interface by sending specially crafted requests to the affected web application endpoint. Since the attack involves remote manipulation of input parameters via standard HTTP requests, an attacker does not need physical access or local system privileges. The attacker can initiate the exploit from any location with network connectivity to the system, making the attack surface broad and accessible remotely."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to craft specific input data that manipulates the argument responsible for processing user input, such as the 'custTradeId' parameter. No additional special conditions or configurations are necessary beyond the presence of the vulnerable endpoint and the ability to send malicious requests. The attack does not depend on complex timing, specific system states, or environmental factors, indicating a straightforward exploitation process once network access is established."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any prior access privileges or authenticated user credentials to exploit the vulnerability. The attack can be carried out by sending malicious input directly to the web interface, which processes the input without requiring the attacker to have any user-level or administrative permissions. This means the attacker operates with no privileges within the system prior to exploiting the flaw."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not necessitate any action or participation from legitimate users of the system. The attacker can initiate the attack independently by sending malicious requests, and the success of the exploit does not depend on any user opening links, executing files, or performing other interactions. The vulnerability can be exploited automatically without any human intervention from other users."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability affects the file /reprotframework/tcEntrFlowSelect.htm via an SQL injection vector on the 'custTradeId' parameter. Given that SQL injection typically targets database operations, exploitation may allow access or manipulation of data beyond the security scope of the affected web component. This could result in unauthorized control over backend databases, potentially impacting other modules or services that share the same data source, thereby crossing defined security boundaries and justifying a 'Changed' scope rating under CVSS v3.1"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection vulnerabilities often permit attackers to extract sensitive information directly from the database. In this case, exploitation of the 'custTradeId' parameter could lead to unauthorized disclosure of customer trade information or other private datasets stored in the backend system. Depending on the database schema and privileges exposed, this could include personally identifiable information (PII), financial records, or proprietary business data, constituting a high impact to confidentiality under CVSS guidelines"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "By manipulating SQL queries, attackers could potentially alter or delete records within the database. This undermines the trustworthiness of the application’s data, allowing for unauthorized updates to transactional records, trade flows, or configurations. The impact to integrity is significant as the attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code to compromise the consistency and accuracy of the information, which could affect decision-making processes or reporting functions that rely on this data"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Although the vulnerability does not directly involve denial-of-service mechanisms, SQL injection can lead to unintended consequences affecting system availability. Crafted queries might lock database tables, induce long-running operations, or crash the underlying database engine, disrupting access to the affected component and any services relying on its data. Remote attack capability and potential for public exploitation heighten the likelihood of these disruptions, presenting at least a moderate impact to system availability"
