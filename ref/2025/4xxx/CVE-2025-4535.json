        "content": "Based on the description of **CVE-2025-4535**, we can analyze and assign **CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics** using the official definitions. Here's a breakdown of each metric with detailed reasoning:\n\n---\n\n### üîπ **1. Attack Vector (AV):** **Network (N)**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The vulnerability can be exploited **remotely**, as explicitly stated: _\"It is possible to launch the attack remotely.\"_\n- This implies that the attacker does **not** need physical access or local/system-level access, and can exploit the vulnerability over a network (e.g., via HTTP request to `/config/config.properties`).\n\n‚úÖ **Value: N (Network)**\n\n---\n\n### üîπ **2. Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- There is **no indication** of any special conditions or requirements that would make exploitation more complex (e.g., race conditions, timing issues, or needing to bypass additional security mechanisms).\n- The description states the vulnerability is in a configuration file and leads to information disclosure, which suggests a **direct and straightforward** exploitation path.\n\n‚úÖ **Value: L (Low)**\n\n---\n\n### üîπ **3. Privileges Required (PR):** **None (N)**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The attacker does **not** need to be authenticated or have any prior access to the system.\n- The description implies that the file `/config/config.properties` is accessible remotely without authentication, leading to information disclosure.\n\n‚úÖ **Value: N (None)**\n\n---\n\n### üîπ **4. User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- There is **no mention** of requiring a user to perform any action (e.g., click a link, open a file).\n- The attacker can exploit the vulnerability **independently**, without user involvement.\n\n‚úÖ **Value: N (None)**\n\n---\n\n### üîπ **5. Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The vulnerability results in **information disclosure** within the same component (Configuration File Handler).\n- There is **no indication** that the vulnerability affects other components or security boundaries (e.g., privilege escalation or cross-component impact).\n\n‚úÖ **Value: U (Unchanged)**\n\n---\n\n### üîπ **6. Confidentiality Impact (C):** **Low (L)**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The vulnerability leads to **information disclosure**, but the severity is not classified as critical.\n- The description does not indicate that **highly sensitive data** (e.g., passwords, private keys, PII) is exposed, only that some information is disclosed.\n- Therefore, the impact is **limited**.\n\n‚úÖ **Value: L (Low)**\n\n---\n\n### üîπ **7. Integrity Impact (I):** **None (N)**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- There is **no indication** that the attacker can modify or tamper with data.\n- The vulnerability is strictly **read-only** in nature (information disclosure).\n\n‚úÖ **Value: N (None)**\n\n---\n\n### üîπ **8. Availability Impact (A):** **None (N)**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The vulnerability does **not** affect the availability of the system or its services.\n- There is no mention of denial-of-service or system crashes.\n\n‚úÖ **Value: N (None)**\n\n---\n\n## ‚úÖ Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score Vector:\n\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N\n```\n\n### üî¢ **Base Score: 5.3 (Medium)**\n\n---\n\n### üîç Summary:\n\n| Metric                  | Value | Reasoning |\n|-------------------------|-------|-----------|\n| **Attack Vector**       | N     | Remotely exploitable |\n| **Attack Complexity**   | L     | No special conditions |\n| **Privileges Required** | N     | No authentication needed |\n| **User Interaction**    | N     | No user involvement |\n| **Scope**               | U     | No cross-boundary impact |\n| **Confidentiality**     | L     | Some information disclosed |\n| **Integrity**           | N     | No data modification |\n| **Availability**        | N     | No service disruption |\n\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like to calculate the **Temporal** or **Environmental** scores as well.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning an attacker does not need physical access to the device or network. They can initiate the attack from any location with internet access, targeting the specific configuration file of the affected system over the network. This broadens the potential attack surface significantly, as the attacker can be geographically distant from the target system"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability does not appear to require any special conditions or configurations beyond what is typically present in the affected system. The attacker only needs to manipulate the configuration file in a specific way to trigger the information disclosure. There are no indications of needing to bypass additional security measures or requiring specific system states, which simplifies the exploitation process"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The description does not specify that the attacker needs any special access rights or elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability. This suggests that the attacker can be an unauthenticated user, meaning they do not need to log in or have any specific user permissions on the system to carry out the attack. This lack of privilege requirement makes the vulnerability more accessible to a wider range of potential attackers"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation of this vulnerability does not require any action from a user other than the attacker. There is no need for a legitimate user to be logged in, perform any specific actions, or interact with the system in any way for the attack to succeed. The attacker can execute the exploit independently, without relying on user participation"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in the Gosuncn Technology Group Audio-Visual Integrated Management Platform 4.0 affects the Configuration File Handler component. Since the issue is confined to the manipulation of the /config/config.properties file, it appears to be limited to the component itself without affecting other components or systems beyond its security scope. Therefore, the scope is likely unchanged, as the vulnerability does not seem to cross security boundaries or impact other resources outside the component's immediate environment"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability leads to information disclosure through manipulation of the /config/config.properties file. This file likely contains sensitive configuration data, which, if accessed, could reveal critical information about the system's configuration and operation. The remote exploitability of this vulnerability increases the risk of unauthorized access to confidential data, potentially exposing sensitive information to attackers"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability description specifically mentions information disclosure, with no indication of data modification or corruption. Therefore, the integrity impact is likely minimal or none, as the exploit does not appear to allow attackers to alter or corrupt data within the system. The focus is on unauthorized access rather than unauthorized modification"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "There is no mention of service disruption, performance degradation, or resource consumption in the description of this vulnerability. The primary impact is information disclosure, suggesting that the availability of the component or system is not directly affected. Thus, the availability impact is likely minimal, as the vulnerability does not appear to degrade or disrupt service operations"
