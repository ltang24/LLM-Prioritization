        "content": "Here‚Äôs a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4536**, based on the official definitions and the provided vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### üß≠ Attack Vector (AV): **Network (AV:N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without physical or local access to the system. This implies that the attacker can initiate the attack over a network (e.g., via HTTP requests to `/sysmgr/user/listByPage`).\n- **Impact**: Highest level of exposure, as remote attacks are easier to scale and automate.\n\n---\n\n### ‚öôÔ∏è Attack Complexity (AC): **Low (AC:L)**\n- **Reasoning**: There‚Äôs no mention of any special conditions or environmental factors that must be met for exploitation. The exploit is publicly disclosed and may be used, suggesting straightforward execution.\n- **Impact**: Minimal barriers to exploitation.\n\n---\n\n### üîê Privileges Required (PR): **None (PR:N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability leads to information disclosure without requiring authentication or elevated privileges. The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any access rights.\n- **Impact**: Increases severity due to ease of exploitation.\n\n---\n\n### üë§ User Interaction (UI): **None (UI:N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The description does not indicate that a user must perform any action (e.g., clicking a link or opening a file) for the vulnerability to be exploited.\n- **Impact**: Fully autonomous exploitation possible.\n\n---\n\n### üîÑ Scope (S): **Unchanged (S:U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability affects the confidentiality of data within the same security scope (the application itself). There‚Äôs no indication that it impacts other components or systems beyond its boundary.\n- **Impact**: No cross-boundary effects.\n\n---\n\n### üïµÔ∏è Confidentiality Impact (C): **High (C:H)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability results in **information disclosure**, and since it‚Äôs classified as **critical**, the exposed data is likely sensitive (e.g., user details, credentials, or internal system data).\n- **Impact**: Significant loss of confidentiality.\n\n---\n\n### üßæ Integrity Impact (I): **None (I:N)**\n- **Reasoning**: There‚Äôs no indication that data can be modified or tampered with. The vulnerability is limited to disclosure.\n- **Impact**: No effect on data integrity.\n\n---\n\n### üìâ Availability Impact (A): **None (A:N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability does not appear to affect system availability (e.g., no denial of service or resource exhaustion).\n- **Impact**: System remains operational.\n\n---\n\n### üßÆ CVSS v3.1 Vector String\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n```\n\n### üìä Base Score: **7.5 (High)**\nThis score reflects a high-severity vulnerability due to remote exploitability, lack of required privileges, and significant confidentiality impact.\n\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like to explore mitigation strategies or compare this with similar CVEs.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability affects a web-accessible endpoint (/sysmgr/user/listByPage), which implies that exploitation can occur over a network without requiring physical access to the device or proximity to the target system. An attacker can initiate the exploit from any location with internet connectivity, assuming the vulnerable service is exposed externally. This remote accessibility significantly broadens the attack surface, allowing threat actors to target systems without prior presence in the local environment"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploit has already been publicly disclosed and is reportedly usable, suggesting that no unusual or unpredictable conditions are necessary for successful exploitation. There is no indication of required environmental factors such as specific configurations, timing constraints, or race conditions. The vulnerability appears to be reliably triggered through direct manipulation of the affected endpoint, which implies a straightforward attack path with minimal dependencies beyond standard access to the vulnerable interface"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The description does not mention any need for authentication or elevated access to reach the vulnerable functionality. The implication is that the endpoint may be accessible without logging in or possessing any user credentials. If true, this means an attacker could exploit the flaw without first compromising an account or gaining any form of authorized access, allowing for immediate exploitation upon discovering the exposed interface"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "There is no mention of any requirement for a legitimate user to perform an action that would enable or facilitate the attack. The vulnerability appears to be triggered solely through crafted requests sent to the affected endpoint, which suggests that exploitation is entirely under the attacker‚Äôs control. The absence of user involvement means the attacker does not need to rely on social engineering, phishing, or tricking a user into executing a specific action"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability affects a specific functionality (/sysmgr/user/listByPage) within the Gosuncn platform, which appears to be an internal component responsible for user listing. Since the manipulation allows remote exploitation and leads to information disclosure, it suggests that the attacker can influence resources beyond the immediate function, potentially impacting other parts of the system or user data. However, there is no indication that the vulnerability enables cross-component or cross-boundary impacts beyond the affected module, so the scope is likely confined to the affected component, but with potential for broader information exposure."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability results in information disclosure through manipulation of the /sysmgr/user/listByPage functionality. This indicates that sensitive user data or internal information managed by the platform could be accessed by an attacker. Since the description emphasizes information disclosure without mention of data modification, the primary impact is on confidentiality, risking exposure of personal or sensitive information stored within the system. The remote exploit capability amplifies the risk, as unauthorized parties could access confidential data remotely."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability description does not specify any ability to modify, delete, or corrupt data within the system. It focuses solely on information disclosure resulting from manipulation of the functionality. Therefore, the potential for integrity impact appears minimal or nonexistent, as there is no indication that the attacker can alter the data or system state directly through this vulnerability. The primary concern is unauthorized access to information rather than data integrity compromise."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "There is no evidence in the description that the vulnerability causes service disruption, crashes, or performance degradation. The manipulation appears to be aimed at extracting information rather than affecting system uptime or resource availability. Consequently, the impact on availability is likely negligible, as the vulnerability does not inherently impair the platform‚Äôs operational status or cause denial-of-service conditions."
