      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in CVE-2025-4575 arises from a logic error in the OpenSSL x509 command-line tool, specifically in how it handles the `-addreject` option. This issue is confined to the behavior of the x509 application and does not inherently affect other components or cross security boundaries. It does not cause a breach in isolation between components or allow an attacker to affect other systems or services outside the intended scope of the x509 tool. Therefore, the vulnerability does not change the scope of impact beyond the component where the vulnerability resides"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "This vulnerability does not directly expose or disclose any sensitive information. The issue lies in the misapplication of trust attributes to certificates, which may cause a certificate to be incorrectly trusted for a use case (e.g., CMS signature verification). However, this misconfiguration does not itself result in unauthorized access to confidential data. Any potential confidentiality risk would be indirect and dependent on further misuse or misinterpretation of the certificate, rather than a direct breach of information confidentiality"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The integrity impact is moderate but indirect. The vulnerability causes a certificate to be incorrectly marked as trusted for a specific use case when it was intended to be rejected. This mislabeling could lead to acceptance of cryptographic operations (e.g., CMS signature verification) that should have been rejected, potentially allowing forged or unauthorized data to be treated as valid. While the underlying data is not modified by the vulnerability itself, the trust decisions based on misconfigured certificates could compromise the integrity of systems relying on accurate certificate validation"

      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "There is no indication that this vulnerability affects the availability of the OpenSSL x509 application or any dependent systems. It does not cause crashes, excessive resource consumption, or service disruption. The issue is limited to incorrect certificate trust labeling and does not interfere with the operational availability of the software or services using the certificates. Therefore, the availability impact is negligible"

        "content": "Let's analyze CVE-2025-4575 using the CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics. The CVSS Base Score reflects the intrinsic characteristics of the vulnerability, independent of environmental factors.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Attack Vector (AV)**\n\n**Definition:** How the vulnerability is exploited ‚Äî Network, Adjacent, Local, or Physical.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The issue involves the use of the `-addreject` option with the `openssl x509` command-line tool.  \n- Exploitation requires access to the command-line interface where the `openssl` tool is run, typically on the local system.  \n- The attacker must have local access or the ability to execute commands on the affected system.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Attack Vector:** **Local (L)**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**\n\n**Definition:** The conditions beyond the attacker's control that must exist for the attack to succeed.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The vulnerability is triggered simply by using the `-addreject` option incorrectly during a command-line operation.  \n- No special conditions or complex sequences are needed; it's a straightforward misuse.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Attack Complexity:** **Low (L)**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Privileges Required (PR)**\n\n**Definition:** The level of privileges an attacker must have to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- Exploiting this issue requires the attacker to execute the `openssl` command with appropriate permissions.  \n- Typically, modifying trust/reject settings involves administrative or equivalent privileges.  \n- The description suggests that only users with command-line access and sufficient permissions can exploit this.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Privileges Required:** **High (H)** (since administrative privileges are needed to modify trust settings)\n\n---\n\n### 4. **User Interaction (UI)**\n\n**Definition:** Whether the attack requires user interaction.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The attacker must run a command with the `-addreject` option; this is a direct action by the attacker.  \n- No additional user interaction is necessary after the attacker has access.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **User Interaction:** **None (N)**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Scope (S)**\n\n**Definition:** Whether the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The issue affects the behavior of the `openssl` command-line tool, specifically trust/reject settings for certificates.  \n- It does not impact other components or systems outside the scope of the `openssl` application.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Scope:** **Unchanged (U)**\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Confidentiality Impact (C)**\n\n**Definition:** The impact on confidentiality.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The vulnerability causes incorrect trust/reject status assignment but does not directly leak or compromise sensitive information.  \n- It can lead to trust decisions being incorrect, but not data disclosure.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Confidentiality Impact:** **None (N)**\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Integrity Impact (I)**\n\n**Definition:** The impact on integrity.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The trust status of certificates is altered, which can affect the integrity of security decisions.  \n- However, it does not directly modify data or system integrity, but trust decisions influence security policies.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Integrity Impact:** **Low (L)**\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Availability Impact (A)**\n\n**Definition:** The impact on availability.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The issue does not cause system downtime or service disruption directly.  \n- It affects trust settings, not system availability.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Availability Impact:** **None (N)**\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**\n\n| Metric                     | Value | Reasoning Summary                                              |\n|----------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Attack Vector (AV)         | **L**   | Exploitation requires local command-line access.             |\n| Attack Complexity (AC)     | **L**   | No special conditions; straightforward misuse.               |\n| Privileges Required (PR)   | **H**   | Administrative privileges needed to modify trust settings.  |\n| User Interaction (UI)      | **N**   | No user interaction needed beyond executing command.        |\n| Scope (S)                  | **U**   | Affects only the local application, not other components.  |\n| Confidentiality Impact (C)| **N**   | No confidentiality breach.                                   |\n| Integrity Impact (I)       | **L**   | Trust status altered, affecting security decisions.        |\n| Availability Impact (A)    | **N**   | No impact on system availability.                            |\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated CVSS v3.1 Base Score:**\n\nGiven the above metrics, the vulnerability is **Low to Medium severity**. The key factors are:\n\n- **Privileges required (High)** significantly increase severity.\n- **Attack vector (Local)** limits exploitability.\n- **Impact on trust settings** can lead to security misconfigurations but does not directly compromise data or availability.\n\n**Approximate Base Score:** **4.0 (Low)**\n\n*Note:* If the privileges required were lower (e.g., user-level), the score could be higher. But given the need for administrative privileges, the overall severity remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** This analysis is based on the provided description and CVSS v3.1 definitions. Actual scoring may vary slightly depending on specific environmental factors or additional context.",

        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in CVE-2025-4575 is confined to the OpenSSL x509 command-line application and does not propagate its effects beyond the component's defined security boundaries. The issue arises from a misinterpretation of the -addreject option, which incorrectly adds a trusted use instead of a rejected one. This behavior does not result in privilege escalation or unauthorized access to other components or systems. Therefore, the scope remains unchanged, as the impact is isolated to the certificate trust configuration within the same component [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4575) [[1]](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4575)"

        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "This vulnerability does not directly expose or disclose sensitive information. The misconfiguration caused by the -addreject option affects how certificates are trusted for specific purposes, such as CMS signature verification. However, it does not enable attackers to read or extract confidential data from the system. Since the certificate remains trusted for unintended uses, it may indirectly allow operations that should have been blocked, but it does not compromise the confidentiality of data managed by the component [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4575) [[1]](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4575)"

This could permit unauthorized validation of signatures or acceptance of data that should have been rejected, potentially leading to subtle data integrity issues. However, it does not allow direct modification or corruption of data, nor does it enable attackers to tamper with system files or configurations outside the certificate trust context [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4575) [[1]](https://www.wiz.io/vulnerability-database/cve/cve-2025-4575)"

        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "This vulnerability involves a misbehavior in the OpenSSL x509 application where the '-addreject' option incorrectly adds a trusted status to a certificate instead of rejecting it. Exploiting this flaw does not require any human user participation beyond the attacker initiating the process; the attacker can craft and execute the command with the malicious option. The attack flow involves the attacker providing a specially crafted certificate or command-line input to the application, which then incorrectly marks the certificate as trusted for specific uses. Since the attacker controls the input and the process, no additional user interaction is necessary for the exploitation to succeed. The vulnerability can be exploited solely by the attacker at their discretion, without requiring any action or participation from other users or administrators."
