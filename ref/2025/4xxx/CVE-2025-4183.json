        "content": "Here's a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4183**, a buffer overflow vulnerability in **PCMan FTP Server 2.0.7** affecting the **RECV Command Handler** [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4183):\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Attack Vector (AV): **Network (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network, as stated in the description. No physical or local access is required.\n- **Definition Match**: The most remote context—network-based exploitation—yields the highest severity for this metric.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ Attack Complexity (AC): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: Buffer overflows typically do not require special conditions beyond sending a crafted input. No environmental or configuration dependencies are mentioned.\n- **Definition Match**: No conditions beyond the attacker’s control are needed, so complexity is low.\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 Privileges Required (PR): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker does not need to authenticate or possess any privileges to exploit the vulnerability.\n- **Definition Match**: Exploitation is possible without any prior access to the system.\n\n---\n\n### 👤 User Interaction (UI): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The exploit does not require any action from a user. It can be triggered directly by the attacker.\n- **Definition Match**: No human interaction is necessary for successful exploitation.\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 Scope (S): **Unchanged (U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The buffer overflow affects the same security authority (the FTP server process). There’s no indication that other components or systems are impacted.\n- **Definition Match**: The impact remains within the vulnerable component’s scope.\n\n---\n\n### 🕵️ Confidentiality Impact (C): **High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Buffer overflows can allow arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n- **Definition Match**: A complete loss of confidentiality is possible.\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 Integrity Impact (I): **High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Arbitrary code execution may allow modification of files or system data.\n- **Definition Match**: Trustworthiness of data can be fully compromised.\n\n---\n\n### 🚫 Availability Impact (A): **High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Buffer overflows often crash services or systems, leading to denial of service.\n- **Definition Match**: Complete loss of availability is plausible.\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 Final CVSS v3.1 Vector and Score\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\nBase Score: 9.8 (Critical)\n```\n\nThis score reflects the severity of a remotely exploitable buffer overflow with no barriers to attack and full impact across confidentiality, integrity, and availability [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4183).\n\nWould you like help comparing this to other vulnerabilities or calculating temporal/environmental scores next?\n\n\n\n> [0] [CVE-2025-4183 - NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4183)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to initiate the exploit over a network connection to the FTP server, meaning the attacker does not need local access or physical proximity. Since the attack can be executed remotely via the server's communication interface, the exploitation does not depend on local access points or physical interaction, making it accessible over the network infrastructure used by the server."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability requires sending a specially crafted command to the server's command handler, which involves manipulating input data to trigger a buffer overflow. The attacker must understand the protocol and craft specific payloads, but no additional complex conditions, such as specific timing or environmental configurations, are necessary. The attack relies primarily on the server accepting and processing malicious input without additional constraints or environmental prerequisites."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "Since the attacker interacts directly with the server's command interface without needing prior authentication or elevated permissions, the exploitation can be carried out without any pre-existing user privileges. The attacker does not need to have an account or administrative rights on the server to send malicious commands, making the required privilege level minimal or nonexistent prior to attack execution."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attack does not depend on any human user within the system performing actions or providing input beyond the attacker themselves. The attacker independently crafts and sends malicious network traffic to the server, and no additional user participation, such as opening files, clicking links, or executing scripts, is necessary for the vulnerability to be exploited successfully."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in the RECV Command Handler of PCMan FTP Server 2.0.7 and results in a buffer overflow. Buffer overflows often allow arbitrary code execution, which can lead to a complete compromise of the affected process. Since the FTP server is a standalone component, but arbitrary code execution could allow the attacker to escalate privileges or interact with other system components beyond the FTP server's intended security scope, this indicates a change in scope. The vulnerability enables the attacker to potentially affect other components or system resources outside the FTP server’s boundary"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "A successful exploitation of a buffer overflow in a network-facing service like an FTP server can lead to arbitrary code execution. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files or credentials handled by the server or even the underlying operating system. Given that FTP servers often store or transmit user data, the attacker could gain unauthorized access to confidential information, such as user credentials, uploaded files, or configuration data. Therefore, the confidentiality impact is high due to the potential for full access to sensitive data"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "With a buffer overflow that may lead to arbitrary code execution, an attacker could modify files, alter server configurations, or inject malicious content into the system. This compromises the integrity of both the FTP server and potentially the underlying system. The attacker could tamper with logs, replace legitimate files with malicious ones, or corrupt data being transferred. Since the vulnerability allows for remote exploitation, the integrity of the system is significantly at risk"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Buffer overflows can crash services or lead to denial-of-service conditions, especially when unhandled exceptions or memory corruption occur. In this case, the vulnerability affects a core command handler of the FTP server, which is critical for its operation. Exploiting the vulnerability could cause the server to crash or become unresponsive, leading to significant disruption of service. Given that the attack is remote and affects a central component, the availability impact is high"
