Here's a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4450**, based on its description and official metric definitions:\n\n---\n\n### ðŸ›  CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Analysis for CVE-2025-4450\n\n| **Metric**                 | **Value**      | **Reasoning** |\n|---------------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)**    | Network (N)    | The vulnerability can be exploited **remotely**, without physical access, indicating a **Network** vector. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)**| Low (L)        | Buffer overflow vulnerabilities triggered by input manipulation tend to require **no special conditions** beyond sending maliciously crafted data, making this **Low complexity**. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | None (N)    | The attack involves manipulating an input argument without needing authentication or prior access, thus **no privileges required**. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | None (N)       | There's no indication that a user needs to perform an action (like clicking a link), so **no interaction is required**. |\n| **Scope (S)**             | Unchanged (U)  | The description does not mention that exploitation affects components outside of the affected one (e.g., crossing trust boundaries), so **Scope is unchanged**. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)**   | High (H)       | Buffer overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution, often allowing attackers to read sensitive memory â€” resulting in **high confidentiality impact**. |\n| **Integrity (I)**         | High (H)       | Exploitation could enable modification of system memory or execution flow, affecting **data or command integrity**. |\n| **Availability (A)**      | High (H)       | Buffer overflows can easily crash services or result in denial of service, hence **high availability impact**. |\n\n---\n\n### ðŸ”’ Summary\n\nThis vulnerability enables **remote, unauthenticated, zero-interaction buffer overflow exploitation** in a discontinued D-Link product.

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible function of the D-Link DIR-619L router firmware, specifically formSetEasy_Wizard. Since the attack can be launched remotely, an attacker does not need physical proximity or access to the local network. Exploitation is feasible over the internet or any routable network path that reaches the deviceâ€™s management interface. This implies that the attacker can initiate the exploit from a distant location, provided the device is exposed to external connections, such as through port forwarding or default WAN access settings"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The buffer overflow is triggered by manipulating a single argument, curTime, which suggests that the exploit does not depend on intricate environmental conditions or rare configurations. There is no indication that the attacker must bypass additional security mechanisms, such as ASLR or DEP, nor that the device must be in a specific operational state. The simplicity of the input manipulation implies that the exploit is straightforward and does not rely on unpredictable factors or timing constraints beyond the attackerâ€™s control"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The description does not mention any need for authentication or prior access to the deviceâ€™s administrative interface. If the vulnerable function is exposed without requiring login credentials, then the attacker can interact with it without possessing any elevated privileges. This means the attacker does not need to be a registered user or have any form of access rights on the device before launching the exploit. The ability to manipulate curTime directly suggests that the attack surface is publicly reachable and does not enforce privilege checks"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "There is no indication that a legitimate user must perform any action to facilitate the exploit. The attacker can trigger the buffer overflow by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable function, which implies that the compromise occurs independently of user behavior. No user clicks, downloads, or interactions are required to initiate or complete the attack. The vulnerability is purely technical and does not rely on social engineering or user cooperation to succeed"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in the formSetEasy_Wizard function of the D-Link DIR-619L router firmware. Since the buffer overflow is triggered by manipulating a single argument (curTime), and the attack is remote, the impact remains confined to the vulnerable component itself. There is no indication that exploitation affects other components or crosses security boundaries such as privilege escalation across system modules or lateral movement into unrelated systems. Therefore, the scope is considered unchanged, meaning the security authority of the impacted component is not extended beyond its original boundary"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The buffer overflow vulnerability allows remote attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code on the device. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive configuration data, such as Wi-Fi credentials, administrative settings, or internal routing information. Given that routers often store and manage private network data, exploitation could result in significant disclosure of confidential information. The impact is considered high because the attacker could gain full visibility into the deviceâ€™s stored data without user interaction or elevated privileges"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow may allow attackers to overwrite memory and inject malicious code, which can alter the routerâ€™s firmware behavior. This could include modifying routing tables, DNS settings, or firewall rules, thereby compromising the integrity of the deviceâ€™s operations. The attacker could also install persistent backdoors or redirect traffic, leading to data tampering or unauthorized configuration changes. The integrity impact is high due to the potential for complete control over system behavior and data manipulation"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Buffer overflows often result in crashes or denial-of-service conditions. In this case, remote exploitation could cause the router to become unresponsive, reboot continuously, or fail to route traffic properly. Additionally, if arbitrary code execution is achieved, the attacker could deliberately consume system resources or disable services, leading to prolonged outages. Since the router is a critical network component, any disruption directly affects network availability. The impact is high due to the potential for complete service disruption and resource exhaustion"
