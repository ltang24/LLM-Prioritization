      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides within a web application component accessible over the network, specifically through the login interface. Since the attacker can initiate the exploit remotely by sending crafted HTTP requests to the server hosting the application, the attack does not require physical access or proximity. The attacker’s ability to reach the server over the internet or network makes exploitation feasible without local or physical access, enabling remote exploitation from any location with network connectivity to the target system."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability involves manipulating a specific input parameter in a web request, which is a straightforward action assuming the attacker can send HTTP requests to the application. No special configurations, environmental conditions, or intricate setups are necessary beyond the attacker’s ability to craft and send a malicious request. The attack does not depend on timing, specific system states, or complex sequences, making the exploitation process relatively simple and not contingent on complex conditions or additional hurdles."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To successfully exploit the vulnerability, the attacker only needs the ability to send malicious input to the login functionality. This does not require prior authentication or elevated permissions within the application or system. The attacker does not need to have any user privileges or administrative rights; instead, the attack can be carried out by an unauthenticated user who can access the login endpoint and manipulate the input parameter accordingly. Therefore, the attacker’s privileges are minimal and do not need to be elevated beforehand."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not require any action or participation from other users or individuals besides the attacker. The attacker can independently craft and send malicious requests to the application without prompting or involving any other human user. The vulnerability is triggered solely by the attacker’s input, and no additional user interaction, such as clicking links, opening files, or providing credentials in a specific manner, is necessary to carry out the attack successfully."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The CVSS v3.1 vector for CVE-2025-4174 specifies Scope as Unchanged, meaning the impact of exploitation is confined to the vulnerable component itself—/login.php in the COVID19 Testing Management System. The SQL injection vulnerability allows manipulation of database queries but does not inherently affect other components or cross security boundaries. There is no indication that exploitation would compromise other systems or services beyond the login interface, so the security scope remains contained within the affected module"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVSS v3.1 rating for Confidentiality Impact is Low, which aligns with the nature of SQL injection in a login form. Attackers may retrieve limited user data such as usernames or hashed passwords, but there is no evidence of access to sensitive medical records or administrative credentials. The vulnerability does not appear to expose high-value or regulated data directly, and the scope of data leakage is likely constrained to authentication-related fields stored in the same database table"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Integrity Impact is rated Low, suggesting that while attackers can manipulate SQL queries, the extent of data corruption or unauthorized modification is limited. The injection point is within the login functionality, which typically does not allow direct modification of stored data. However, attackers might bypass authentication or alter session states, which could lead to unauthorized access but not widespread data tampering. The vulnerability does not enable arbitrary updates or deletions across the database schema"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Availability Impact is also rated Low, indicating that exploitation is unlikely to cause significant service disruption. SQL injection in a login form may allow unauthorized access but does not inherently consume system resources or crash the application. There is no evidence of denial-of-service vectors such as recursive queries or resource exhaustion. The system may remain operational even if compromised, and performance degradation would be minimal unless chained with other vulnerabilities"
