        "content": "To analyze CVE-2025-4762 using the CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics, we will evaluate each metric based on the official CVSS definitions and the information provided in the vulnerability description. Here's the detailed reasoning:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**  \n- **Definition:** This metric reflects how the vulnerability is exploited. The more remote the attacker can be, the higher the score.  \n- **Reasoning:** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to manipulate file paths and object identifiers to access arbitrary files. This suggests that exploitation occurs over a network (e.g., via HTTP requests to the eSignaViewer component). Since no physical or local access is required, the attack vector is **Network**.  \n- **Value:** **Network (N)**  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**  \n- **Definition:** This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker's control that must exist to exploit the vulnerability.  \n- **Reasoning:** The description does not mention any significant prerequisites or conditions that would make exploitation difficult. The attacker only needs to manipulate file paths or object identifiers, which is straightforward and does not depend on external factors like race conditions or specific configurations.  \n- **Value:** **Low (L)**  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**  \n- **Definition:** This metric captures the level of privileges an attacker must have to exploit the vulnerability.  \n- **Reasoning:** The vulnerability explicitly states that it can be exploited by an **unauthenticated attacker**, meaning no privileges are required.  \n- **Value:** **None (N)**  \n\n---\n\n### **4. User Interaction (UI): None (N)**  \n- **Definition:** This metric determines whether exploitation requires user interaction.  \n- **Reasoning:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability directly by sending crafted requests to the eSignaViewer component. No user interaction (e.g., clicking a link or opening a file) is required.  \n- **Value:** **None (N)**  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**  \n- **Definition:** This metric indicates whether exploitation of the vulnerability affects resources beyond the vulnerable component.  \n- **Reasoning:** The vulnerability allows access to arbitrary files within the document system of the eSigna product. However, there is no indication that exploitation impacts other components or systems outside the scope of the eSignaViewer component.  \n- **Value:** **Unchanged (U)**  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Confidentiality (C): High (H)**  \n- **Definition:** This metric measures the impact on the confidentiality of information.  \n- **Reasoning:** The vulnerability allows attackers to access arbitrary files in the document system. Depending on the files accessed, this could lead to exposure of sensitive or confidential information. Therefore, the impact on confidentiality is **High**.  \n- **Value:** **High (H)**  \n\n---\n\n### **7. Integrity (I): None (N)**  \n- **Definition:** This metric measures the impact on the integrity of information.  \n- **Reasoning:** The vulnerability description does not indicate any ability to modify or corrupt files. The attack is limited to unauthorized access to files, so there is no impact on integrity.  \n- **Value:** **None (N)**  \n\n---\n\n### **8. Availability (A): None (N)**  \n- **Definition:** This metric measures the impact on the availability of the affected component.  \n- **Reasoning:** The vulnerability does not affect the availability of the eSignaViewer component or the document system. There is no indication of denial-of-service or resource exhaustion.  \n- **Value:** **None (N)**  \n\n---\n\n### **CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation**  \nUsing the CVSS v3.1 calculator with the selected metrics:  \n\n- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)  \n- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)  \n- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)  \n- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)  \n- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)  \n- **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)  \n- **Integrity (I):** None (N)  \n- **Availability (A):** None (N)  \n\n**Base Score:** **7.5 (High)**  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary of CVSS v3.1 Metrics for CVE-2025-4762**  \n\n| **Metric**              | **Value**       |  \n|--------------------------|-----------------|  \n| **Attack Vector (AV)**   | Network (N)     |  \n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | Low (L)       |  \n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | None (N)    |  \n| **User Interaction (UI)** | None (N)       |  \n| **Scope (S)**            | Unchanged (U)   |  \n| **Confidentiality (C)**  | High (H)        |  \n| **Integrity (I)**        | None (N)        |  \n| **Availability (A)**     | None (N)        |  \n\n**Base Score:** **7.5 (High)**  \n\nThis score reflects the significant confidentiality impact of the vulnerability, combined with the ease of exploitation and lack of prerequisites.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit it remotely by manipulating file paths and object identifiers within the eSignaViewer component, which is accessible over the network or via the application interface. Since no authentication is required, the attacker does not need physical access or local system privileges, making the attack feasible from a remote location through standard network interactions or client-side manipulations."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploitation requires the attacker to craft specific input data, such as manipulated file paths or object identifiers, to access arbitrary files. This involves understanding the application's internal handling of file references and exploiting insufficient validation or access controls. The attacker does not need to bypass complex security mechanisms or perform multiple steps beyond the initial manipulation, but must have knowledge of the application's file structure or object identifiers, which may require some reconnaissance or prior information."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any prior access privileges or authentication to exploit this vulnerability. Since the flaw permits unauthenticated access to files through manipulation of parameters, the attacker operates without any user privileges within the system. No elevated permissions are necessary to initiate the attack, as the vulnerability is accessible to anyone who can interact with the component's interface or network endpoints."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation does not depend on the participation or actions of any legitimate user within the system. The attacker can perform the necessary manipulations independently, without requiring a user to click links, open files, or perform other actions that involve human participation. The vulnerability can be exploited automatically or via crafted requests without involving or alerting other users, making user interaction unnecessary for successful exploitation."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to access arbitrary files within the document system by manipulating file paths and object identifiers, which indicates that the attack impacts resources beyond the immediate component. Since the exploitation can lead to access of other system files or data outside the specific component, it crosses security boundaries, thereby affecting resources beyond the initial scope of the eSignaViewer component. Therefore, the scope is considered 'Changed', as it impacts additional resources beyond the original component boundary."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The IDOR vulnerability enables unauthorized access to arbitrary files stored within the document system, potentially exposing sensitive or confidential documents. Since these files may contain private, proprietary, or regulated data, their disclosure compromises confidentiality. The attacker can access information that should be restricted, leading to significant confidentiality impacts, especially if sensitive or personally identifiable information is involved."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability primarily facilitates unauthorized reading of files rather than modification. There is no indication that an attacker can alter or corrupt data through this exploit; it is focused on unauthorized access rather than data integrity. Therefore, the impact on integrity is minimal or none, as the vulnerability does not inherently allow data modification or corruption."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to resource exhaustion or system instability if, for example, an attacker repeatedly accesses large files or triggers excessive file retrieval operations. However, the primary impact appears to be unauthorized access rather than direct service disruption. Unless the exploitation leads to system crashes or performance degradation, the availability impact is likely limited. Nonetheless, potential for indirect availability issues exists if exploited at scale."
