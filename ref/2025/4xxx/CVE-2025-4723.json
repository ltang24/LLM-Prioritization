      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible PHP file, /all_student.php, which processes user-supplied input via the 'delete' parameter. Because this file is part of a web application, an attacker can exploit it by sending crafted HTTP requests over the internet without needing physical access or proximity to the target system. This means the attacker can initiate the attack from any location with network connectivity, making the exploitation feasible from a remote environment. The exposure of this endpoint to public access significantly broadens the attack surface and increases the likelihood of exploitation"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation involves injecting malicious SQL statements through a query parameter, which is a well-known and straightforward technique. There is no indication that the attacker must bypass any additional security mechanisms, such as input validation filters, authentication gates, or environmental constraints. The vulnerability appears to be triggered directly by manipulating a single parameter, suggesting that no special configurations, timing conditions, or race conditions are required. The simplicity of the attack path implies that exploitation is highly repeatable and does not depend on unpredictable or external factors"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The description does not mention any requirement for the attacker to authenticate or possess access credentials before exploiting the vulnerability. The fact that the attack can be launched remotely and targets a publicly accessible script suggests that the vulnerable functionality is exposed to unauthenticated users. Therefore, the attacker does not need to log in or escalate privileges to reach the vulnerable code path. This implies that the system fails to enforce access controls on the affected endpoint, allowing exploitation without prior access or elevated permissions"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The SQL injection is triggered by sending a crafted request to the server, specifically by manipulating the 'delete' parameter in the URL or form submission. There is no indication that a legitimate user must perform any action, such as clicking a link, opening a file, or executing a command, for the attack to succeed. The attacker can initiate and complete the exploit independently, without relying on social engineering or user behavior. This means the compromise occurs entirely through attacker-controlled input and does not require any cooperation or interaction from other users"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in the /all_student.php component of the Placement Management System and is triggered via SQL injection through the 'delete' parameter. Based on CVSS v3.1 definitions, the Scope is Unchanged because the impact is confined to the same security authority—the database accessed by the vulnerable web application. There is no indication that exploitation affects other components outside the original trust boundary, such as the operating system or external services. The SQL injection manipulates queries within the same application context, without crossing into other security domains"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The SQL injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive student data stored in the database. This includes personal identifiers, academic records, and possibly login credentials. Since the attacker can remotely exploit the flaw without authentication, the risk of data exposure is significant. According to CVSS v3.1, this results in a Low confidentiality impact because while data can be accessed, the scope of exposure is limited to the database contents and does not include broader system-level secrets or external data sources"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "By manipulating the 'delete' parameter, attackers can potentially alter or delete records in the student database. This compromises the integrity of the system by allowing unauthorized modifications to critical data such as student profiles, placement records, or administrative logs. The ability to tamper with data directly affects the trustworthiness of the application’s outputs. CVSS v3.1 classifies this as a Low integrity impact, as the changes are confined to the database and do not propagate to other systems or components beyond the vulnerable application"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability could be exploited to execute destructive SQL commands, such as dropping tables or triggering resource-intensive queries that degrade performance. This can lead to partial or complete denial of service for users accessing the Placement Management System. However, there is no evidence of persistent service outages or system-wide crashes. Therefore, under CVSS v3.1, the availability impact is considered Low, as the disruption is limited to the application’s database and does not extend to infrastructure-level services or broader network resources"
