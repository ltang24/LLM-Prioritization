        "content": "Based on the provided information for **CVE-2025-4156**, we can analyze and assign CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics as follows:\n\n---\n\n### üîç **Vulnerability Summary:**\n\n- **Product**: PHPGurukul Boat Booking System 1.0  \n- **File Affected**: `/admin/change-image.php`  \n- **Vulnerability Type**: SQL Injection via `ID` parameter  \n- **Attack Vector**: Remote  \n- **Exploit Status**: Publicly disclosed and potentially usable  \n- **Impact**: Potential compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and possibly availability  \n- **Privileges**: Not specified, but likely requires authentication due to `/admin/` path\n\n---\n\n## üîê **CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Analysis**\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Attack Vector (AV):** **Network (N)**\n\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests (as it's in a web application). The attacker does not need physical or local access.\n- **Value**: `AV:N`\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Attack Complexity (AC):** **Low (L)**\n\n- **Reasoning**: SQL injection vulnerabilities typically do not require special conditions or complex steps. If the parameter is injectable, the attacker can directly send payloads.\n- **Value**: `AC:L`\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Privileges Required (PR):** **Low (L)**\n\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerable script is located in `/admin/change-image.php`, which strongly implies that authentication is required. However, if the attacker only needs **low-level (admin) credentials** to access the vulnerable page, then `PR:L` is appropriate.\n  - If the vulnerability were accessible **without authentication**, this would be `PR:N`.\n  - Since it's in an admin path, we assume **some privileges are needed**, but not high-level system access.\n- **Value**: `PR:L`\n\n---\n\n### 4. **User Interaction (UI):** **None (N)**\n\n- **Reasoning**: SQL injection does not require user interaction. The attacker sends a crafted request; no user needs to click or perform any action.\n- **Value**: `UI:N`\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Scope (S):** **Unchanged (U)**\n\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability affects the same security scope (e.g., the web application and its database). There's no indication that it allows access to other systems or components outside the vulnerable component‚Äôs authority.\n- **Value**: `S:U`\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Confidentiality Impact (C):** **High (H)**\n\n- **Reasoning**: SQL injection can allow attackers to **exfiltrate sensitive data** from the database (e.g., user credentials, personal data, etc.). This is a **high** impact on confidentiality.\n- **Value**: `C:H`\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Integrity Impact (I):** **High (H)**\n\n- **Reasoning**: SQL injection can allow attackers to **modify or delete data** in the database, impacting the integrity of the system.\n- **Value**: `I:H`\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Availability Impact (A):** **High (H)**\n\n- **Reasoning**: In many cases, SQL injection can be used to **delete tables**, **drop the database**, or otherwise render the application unusable. This justifies a **high** impact on availability.\n- **Value**: `A:H`\n\n---\n\n## üßÆ **CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation**\n\nUsing the vector:\n\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n```\n\nWe calculate the base score:\n\n- **Base Score**: **9.1 (Critical)**\n\n---\n\n## ‚úÖ **Summary Table**\n\n| Metric                     | Value | Reasoning |\n|---------------------------|-------|-----------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)**    | N     | Remote exploitation via web |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)**| L     | No special conditions required |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)**| L   | Likely requires admin login |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | N     | No user interaction needed |\n| **Scope (S)**             | U     | No cross-boundary impact |\n| **Confidentiality (C)**   | H     | Data exfiltration possible |\n| **Integrity (I)**         | H     | Data modification/deletion possible |\n| **Availability (A)**      | H     | Potential for DoS via DB manipulation |\n\n---\n\n## üèÅ Final CVSS Vector and Score\n\n**CVSS Vector**: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`  \n**Base Score**: **9.1 (Critical)**\n\nLet me know if you want an Environmental or Temporal score as well.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to initiate exploitation over a network interface accessible to remote actors, meaning that the attacker does not need physical access or local network access to the system. The attacker can send crafted requests directly to the web application's endpoint from any location capable of reaching the server, making the attack feasible without proximity constraints."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to craft a specific HTTP request that manipulates the 'ID' parameter in the affected script. Since the attack involves sending a specially crafted input over the network without additional complex conditions or configurations, the exploitation does not depend on particular system states or intricate setups beyond standard web request handling. Therefore, the conditions for successful exploitation are straightforward and do not involve complex prerequisites."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the web application's endpoint. They do not need to be authenticated or possess any prior privileges within the system. The attacker‚Äôs actions are performed externally, without requiring any existing user credentials or elevated permissions, as the attack vector is accessible directly through the web interface."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attacker can execute the exploit independently by sending malicious requests without any involvement or participation from other users. No human user within the victim environment needs to perform any action, such as clicking links or opening files, for the attack to succeed. The exploitation process is fully automated and does not rely on any user interaction beyond the attacker's initial request."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in the PHPGurukul Boat Booking System 1.0 involves SQL injection, which can potentially affect the database management system beyond the immediate application. If exploited, it could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands that might impact other applications or systems connected to the same database, thereby crossing security boundaries and affecting resources beyond the initial component's scope"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The SQL injection vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the database. This could include user information, booking details, and other confidential records managed by the system, resulting in a significant breach of confidentiality"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "By exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can alter database contents, such as modifying user records, changing booking details, or even injecting malicious data. This compromises the integrity of the data, as unauthorized changes can lead to corrupted information and undermine the trustworthiness of the system's data"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The SQL injection could be used to execute commands that disrupt database operations, such as dropping tables or executing resource-intensive queries that degrade performance. This can lead to partial or complete denial of service, affecting the availability of the PHPGurukul Boat Booking System and potentially rendering it unusable until restored"
