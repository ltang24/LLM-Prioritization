Here's a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics assessment for **CVE-2025-4331**, based on the provided information:\n\n---\n\n### üîê CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Evaluation for CVE-2025-4331\n\n| Metric                | Value          | Reasoning |\n|----------------------|----------------|-----------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)** | **Network (N)** | The vulnerability is in a web-based login script (`/Admin/login.php`) and can be exploited remotely over a network, which aligns with the \"Network\" value. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)** | SQL injection typically doesn‚Äôt require special conditions beyond crafting malicious input. The attacker can exploit it reliably without needing uncommon system states. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None (N)** | Since the login page is publicly accessible, exploitation can occur without any prior authentication or access privileges. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)** | SQL injection attacks do not require a victim to interact‚Äîan attacker sends malicious input directly to the vulnerable endpoint. |\n| **Scope (S)** | **Unchanged (U)** | The vulnerability affects the application's own database via SQL injection, and there‚Äôs no indication of impact beyond its security scope (e.g., operating system or other services). |\n| **Confidentiality Impact (C)** | **High (H)** | A successful SQL injection could expose sensitive user data (e.g., usernames, passwords, student records), thus posing a serious breach of confidentiality. |\n| **Integrity Impact (I)** | **High (H)** | Attackers could modify or insert unauthorized data, compromising the reliability and accuracy of the database. |\n| **Availability Impact (A)** | **High (H)** | SQL injection could allow deletion of records or even a complete denial-of-service on the application through database tampering. |\n\n---\n\n### üìä CVSS Base Score Summary\nUsing these values:\n\n```\nAV:N / AC:L / PR:N / UI:N / S:U / C:H / I:H / A:H\n```\n\nThis produces a **CVSS v3.1 Base Score of 10.0 (Critical)**‚Äîreflecting the severity suggested in the description.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like this in vector format, JSON, or as part of a vulnerability report template üìÑ",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible login script, which means an attacker can initiate the exploit simply by sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected endpoint. No physical access or proximity to the target system is necessary. The attacker can operate from any location with internet connectivity, targeting the system over standard web protocols. This remote accessibility significantly broadens the potential attack surface and allows exploitation without any direct interaction with the host environment"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploitation of this vulnerability does not appear to require any unusual environmental conditions or specific system configurations. The SQL injection is triggered through direct manipulation of input parameters such as id, username, or password, which are commonly used in login forms. There is no indication that the attacker must bypass additional security mechanisms, perform timing-based attacks, or rely on race conditions. The exploit is straightforward and can be executed using basic tools or scripts without needing to adapt to unpredictable system states"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker targets the login interface, which is typically accessible to unauthenticated users. Since the injection occurs during the authentication process itself, the attacker does not need to possess any prior access credentials or elevated permissions. The vulnerability is exploitable before any form of login is completed, allowing the attacker to interact with the system as an anonymous user and still achieve compromise through crafted input"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploit scenario does not involve any actions from legitimate users. The attacker initiates the malicious request directly to the vulnerable endpoint without requiring a victim to click links, open files, or perform any other interaction. The compromise is achieved entirely through automated or manual requests sent by the attacker, and no social engineering or user cooperation is necessary for successful exploitation"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in the /Admin/login.php component, which is part of the administrative interface of the system. Since SQL injection can allow attackers to execute arbitrary queries within the database, it potentially enables access to other parts of the system or database beyond the immediate login function. If exploited, it could lead to privilege escalation or data exfiltration across security boundaries, thus impacting resources beyond the initial component scope."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited to retrieve sensitive information stored within the database, such as user credentials, personal data, or administrative records. By manipulating input parameters, an attacker could disclose confidential data that the system manages, leading to a significant confidentiality breach of protected information resources."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Exploiting the SQL injection could allow an attacker to modify or corrupt data within the database, such as altering user records, changing system configurations, or inserting malicious data. This impacts the integrity of the information stored, potentially leading to inconsistent or malicious data states that undermine system trustworthiness."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While SQL injection primarily affects data confidentiality and integrity, it can also impact availability if exploited to perform destructive operations like data deletion or database crashes. Such actions may cause service disruptions, degraded performance, or resource exhaustion, thereby impairing the system‚Äôs overall availability."
