        "content": "Here‚Äôs a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metric analysis for **CVE-2025-4266** based on the provided information:\n\n---\n\n### ‚öîÔ∏è Attack Vector (AV): **Network**\n- **Reasoning**: The description states that the attack can be launched *remotely*, which implies network-based access over HTTP or similar protocols. No local access, physical proximity, or adjacent network constraints are required.\n\n---\n\n### ‚öôÔ∏è Attack Complexity (AC): **Low**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability is a direct **SQL injection** via the `fromdate`/`tomdate` parameters. This type of input manipulation typically requires no special conditions or prior knowledge‚Äîjust a crafted request‚Äîmaking it a low-complexity attack.\n\n---\n\n### üßë‚Äçüíª Privileges Required (PR): **None**\n- **Reasoning**: There's no indication the attacker needs to authenticate or possess any special access to trigger the injection. If exploitation occurs directly through a public-facing endpoint, it qualifies for ‚ÄúNone‚Äù.\n\n---\n\n### üôç User Interaction (UI): **None**\n- **Reasoning**: The exploit does not require any user involvement. The attacker sends malicious input directly to the vulnerable component.\n\n---\n\n### üß© Scope (S): **Unchanged**\n- **Reasoning**: From the details provided, the vulnerability affects the same security authority and resource context. There‚Äôs no evidence of it leading to impacts outside its intended boundary, such as another system component or privilege domain.\n\n---\n\n### üîí Confidentiality Impact (C): **High**\n- **Reasoning**: Successful SQL injection may allow the attacker to extract sensitive data such as usernames, emails, or even passwords from the backend database. This is considered a high impact on confidentiality.\n\n---\n\n### üß¨ Integrity Impact (I): **High**\n- **Reasoning**: SQL injection can also permit unauthorized changes to stored data‚Äîmodifying records, injecting false data, or tampering with content‚Äîwhich constitutes a high impact on integrity.\n\n---\n\n### üîß Availability Impact (A): **High**\n- **Reasoning**: If the attacker can execute payloads that crash the database or make services unavailable through crafted queries, the availability of the affected system could be significantly compromised. SQL injection often leads to denial-of-service when poorly handled.\n\n---\n\n### üìä Summary: CVSS v3.1 Vector String\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n```\nThis corresponds to a **CVSS Base Score of 9.8 (Critical)**.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like this translated into a report format or visualized in a chart‚Äîhappy to help.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible PHP file that processes user-supplied parameters via HTTP requests. Since the attacker can manipulate the 'fromdate' and 'tomdate' parameters directly through a browser or automated script without needing access to the local system or internal network, exploitation can occur from any location with internet connectivity. This means the attacker does not need to be physically close to the target or have access to a specific network segment, making the exploitation context broadly accessible"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation relies solely on injecting malicious SQL syntax into standard input fields without requiring any special environmental conditions. There is no indication that the attacker must bypass additional security mechanisms, such as CAPTCHA, input validation, or authentication workflows. The vulnerable endpoint appears to process input directly, suggesting that the conditions for successful exploitation are consistent and predictable across deployments, with no need for prior configuration changes or timing-based manipulations"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted input to a public-facing script without needing to authenticate or possess any user account. There is no mention of access control mechanisms or session requirements that would restrict access to the vulnerable functionality. This implies that the attacker does not need to escalate privileges or obtain credentials before launching the attack, allowing exploitation from an unauthenticated state"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is triggered solely through the attacker‚Äôs manipulation of HTTP parameters, and there is no indication that a legitimate user must perform any action such as clicking a link, opening a file, or interacting with the application. The exploit can be executed entirely by the attacker without relying on social engineering or user behavior, meaning the compromise does not depend on any user participation"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The CVSS v3.1 vector for CVE-2025-4266 indicates Scope: Unchanged, meaning the vulnerability affects only the component in which it resides‚ÄîPHPGurukul Notice Board System 1.0. The SQL injection occurs within the same security boundary and does not impact other components or systems outside the vulnerable application. There is no evidence of privilege escalation or lateral movement to other services, so the impact remains confined to the Notice Board System itself"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVSS v3.1 rating assigns a Low confidentiality impact, which suggests that exploitation of the SQL injection may allow limited access to sensitive data. Attackers could potentially retrieve information such as user records, notices, or internal logs stored in the backend database. However, the lack of elevated privileges and absence of deeper system compromise implies that highly sensitive or system-wide data is not exposed. The risk is real but constrained to the application's data scope"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Integrity is rated Low, indicating that while attackers may be able to manipulate SQL queries, the extent of data corruption or unauthorized modification is limited. The vulnerability could allow changes to specific database entries‚Äîsuch as altering notice content or timestamps‚Äîbut does not enable full control over the database schema or system files. The attack does not appear to support persistent or systemic data tampering beyond the immediate application context"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Availability is also rated Low, meaning the vulnerability does not significantly disrupt the service. Although SQL injection can sometimes be used to exhaust resources or crash the database, this instance does not demonstrate such behavior. The application may experience minor performance degradation or temporary unavailability if exploited repeatedly, but it does not result in prolonged downtime or denial-of-service conditions. The impact is minimal and localized"
