        "content": "Here’s a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4328**, based on the official definitions and the vulnerability description provided:\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Attack Vector (AV): **Network (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests by manipulating the `Referer` header. No physical or local access is required.\n- **Conclusion**: The attacker can launch the attack over a network, making this a **Network** vector.\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 Attack Complexity (AC): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The exploit involves a straightforward manipulation of the `Referer` header to redirect users. No special conditions, timing, or environmental factors are needed.\n- **Conclusion**: The attack does not require any complex setup or circumvention, so the complexity is **Low**.\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 Privileges Required (PR): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker likely needs access to a context where they can influence or craft HTTP requests with a malicious `Referer` header. This may require some level of access, such as authenticated user privileges.\n- **Conclusion**: Since the attacker needs **some** privileges but not administrative ones, this is rated **Low**.\n\n---\n\n### 👤 User Interaction (UI): **Required (R)**\n- **Reasoning**: Open redirect vulnerabilities typically require a user to click a crafted link or be redirected via a manipulated header. The user’s action is essential for exploitation.\n- **Conclusion**: A human user must participate, so **User Interaction is Required**.\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 Scope (S): **Unchanged (U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The impact is confined to the vulnerable component (the HTTP handler). It does not affect other components or systems beyond its security scope.\n- **Conclusion**: The scope remains **Unchanged**.\n\n---\n\n### 🔒 Confidentiality (C): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: Open redirects do not directly expose or compromise sensitive data. They may lead to phishing or social engineering, but that’s indirect.\n- **Conclusion**: No confidentiality impact, so **None**.\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 Integrity (I): **Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker can influence the redirect destination, potentially misleading users or altering intended navigation. This is a minor integrity violation.\n- **Conclusion**: Integrity impact is **Low**.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ Availability (A): **None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability does not affect system availability or cause denial of service.\n- **Conclusion**: No availability impact, so **None**.\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 Final Vector String\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N\n```\n\nThis results in a **Base Score of 3.5 (Low severity)** [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4328).\n\nLet me know if you’d like to explore Temporal or Environmental metrics next, or compare this to similar CVEs.\n\n\n\n> [0] [CVE-2025-4328 - NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4328)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in the HTTP header handling logic of a web-accessible controller, specifically involving manipulation of the 'Referer' header. Since the attack can be launched without physical access and is triggered by sending crafted HTTP requests to the exposed endpoint, exploitation is feasible from any location with internet connectivity. This implies that an attacker does not need to be within the same network or have proximity to the target system, making the exploitation context highly accessible and remote in nature"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploit relies on the application’s failure to properly validate the 'Referer' header before redirecting the user. No special configurations, environmental conditions, or race conditions are required. The attacker simply needs to craft a malicious URL that includes a manipulated 'Referer' value and deliver it to the target system. The absence of any dependency on external systems, timing constraints, or unpredictable behavior indicates that the conditions for exploitation are straightforward and consistent across deployments"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker does not need to authenticate or possess any elevated permissions within the application. The vulnerable endpoint is part of a public-facing controller that processes HTTP headers, and the manipulation occurs before any access control checks. This means the attacker can initiate the exploit without logging in or having any user role, making it accessible to unauthenticated users"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "Successful exploitation requires that a user be redirected through a crafted link containing a manipulated 'Referer' header. The application then processes this header and performs a redirect to an attacker-controlled destination. This implies that the user must click or otherwise interact with the malicious link for the exploit to succeed. Without this user action, the crafted request would not be processed in a way that triggers the vulnerability"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in CVE-2025-4328 involves an open redirect via manipulation of the HTTP Referer header in the `sendBack` function of the MvcController. This flaw allows attackers to redirect users to external, potentially malicious domains. However, the exploit remains confined to the HTTP header handling logic within the same web application component. It does not breach boundaries to affect other security domains such as the operating system, database, or other microservices. Therefore, the scope remains unchanged, as the impact is limited to the vulnerable component itself without crossing into other security authorities"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "Open redirect vulnerabilities typically do not directly expose sensitive data managed by the vulnerable component. In CVE-2025-4328, the attacker manipulates the Referer header to redirect users to arbitrary URLs, which may lead to phishing or social engineering attacks. However, the vulnerability itself does not grant access to internal data or allow unauthorized disclosure of information stored or processed by the application. Thus, the confidentiality impact is minimal or none, as the flaw does not compromise the confidentiality of the system’s resources directly"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The integrity of the system is not directly affected by this vulnerability. CVE-2025-4328 allows redirection to external sites but does not enable the attacker to alter, inject, or corrupt data within the application or its backend systems. There is no evidence of unauthorized modification of content, configuration, or user data. While users may be tricked into visiting malicious sites, the vulnerable component itself does not suffer data integrity violations. Therefore, the integrity impact is considered none or very low"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "This vulnerability does not affect the availability of the application or its services. CVE-2025-4328 is an open redirect issue that manipulates user navigation but does not consume system resources, crash services, or degrade performance. The application continues to function normally, and no denial-of-service condition is introduced. As such, the availability impact is negligible, since the vulnerability does not interfere with the system’s ability to deliver its intended services"
