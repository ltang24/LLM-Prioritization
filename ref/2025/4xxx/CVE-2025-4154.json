        "content": "Here’s a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4154**, based on the official definitions and the vulnerability description:\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via manipulation of a web-accessible parameter (`Status` in `/admin/enrollment-details.php`). This implies the attacker does not need local access or proximity.\n- **Value**: **Network**\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: SQL injection typically requires no special conditions beyond sending crafted input. The exploit is publicly disclosed and usable, suggesting no unpredictable factors or environmental dependencies.\n- **Value**: **Low**\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 **Privileges Required (PR): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerable endpoint is in the `/admin/` directory, which may imply some level of access is needed. However, since the exact access control is unclear and the exploit is publicly usable, a conservative estimate is that **low privileges** (e.g., authenticated user) are required.\n- **Value**: **Low**\n\n---\n\n### 👤 **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: SQL injection occurs purely through crafted requests and does not require any action from another user (e.g., clicking links or opening files).\n- **Value**: **None**\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability affects the same security authority (the web application backend). There’s no indication that it impacts other components or systems beyond its scope.\n- **Value**: **Unchanged**\n\n---\n\n### 🔒 **Confidentiality Impact (C): High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: SQL injection can allow attackers to read sensitive data from the database, including user records, credentials, or personal information.\n- **Value**: **High**\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 **Integrity Impact (I): High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Attackers may be able to modify or delete data in the database, compromising its integrity.\n- **Value**: **High**\n\n---\n\n### 📉 **Availability Impact (A): High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: SQL injection can be used to drop tables or disrupt database operations, leading to denial of service.\n- **Value**: **High**\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 **CVSS v3.1 Vector String**\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n```\n\n### 📊 **Base Score: 8.8 (High)**\nThis score reflects a serious vulnerability with high impact and low complexity, though mitigated slightly by requiring low-level privileges [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4154).\n\nWould you like help comparing this to CVSS v4.0 or exploring mitigation strategies?\n\n\n\n> [0] [NVD - CVE-2025-4154](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4154)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the flaw over a network connection without needing physical access or proximity. Since the affected functionality is accessible via a web interface, an attacker can initiate the attack remotely by sending crafted HTTP requests over the internet or any network where the application is accessible, making the exploitation possible without local or physical interaction."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to craft specific input data that manipulates the 'Status' parameter in the web application's request. The attacker does not need to bypass any complex authentication or security controls beyond knowing the target URL and understanding the input structure. No special configurations or environmental conditions are necessary; the attack hinges on the application's handling of user-supplied data, which is inherently straightforward once the attacker can reach the application."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To successfully exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must have access to the web application's interface with sufficient permissions to submit or manipulate data in the affected parameter. Typically, this means the attacker needs at least the privileges of a standard user or an attacker who can send requests to the application. They do not need administrative or elevated privileges beforehand, but they must be able to interact with the application's input fields or parameters to carry out the injection."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not depend on any action or participation from other users besides the attacker. The attacker can initiate the attack independently by sending specially crafted requests directly to the web application. No additional human involvement, such as convincing a user to click a link or perform an action, is necessary for the attack to succeed once the attacker has access to the network interface."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The scope of this vulnerability is unchanged. The SQL injection vulnerability in the PHPGurukul Pre-School Enrollment System affects the component directly handling the SQL queries. While the vulnerability allows for significant manipulation within the database, it does not inherently extend beyond the security scope of the affected component to other components or systems"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The confidentiality impact is high. SQL injection can allow attackers to access sensitive information stored in the database, such as personal details of enrolled students, administrative data, and potentially other confidential information managed by the system. Unauthorized access to this data compromises its confidentiality"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The integrity impact is high. Through SQL injection, attackers can modify or delete data within the database. This could involve changing enrollment details, altering administrative records, or corrupting data, leading to a loss of data integrity and reliability"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The availability impact is high. An attacker could use SQL injection to execute commands that disrupt the database's operation, such as dropping tables or causing extensive locking, which could render the system unavailable or significantly degrade its performance"
