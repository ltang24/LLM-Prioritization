      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited over a network connection, meaning an attacker can initiate the attack from a remote location without needing physical access to the affected system. This remote initiation capability significantly broadens the potential attack surface, as the attacker does not need to be in close proximity to the target system"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability does not require any special conditions or configurations beyond the standard setup of the affected software. The attack can be carried out without needing to manipulate the environment or rely on specific system states, making it straightforward for an attacker to exploit under normal operating conditions"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need to have any special privileges or access rights on the target system to exploit this vulnerability. The attack can be executed without prior authentication or elevated permissions, allowing any user, including unauthenticated ones, to potentially exploit the flaw"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "No interaction from a legitimate user is necessary for the attacker to exploit this vulnerability. The attack can be performed without requiring any actions, such as clicking on a link or opening a file, from users of the system, making the exploitation process independent of user behavior"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability affects an API endpoint (/api/GylOperator/LoadData) within the Shenzhen Sixun Software system, which appears to be part of a specific business management application. Since the issue involves information disclosure through manipulation of this component, and there is no indication that exploiting it allows access to other components or broader system resources, the scope remains confined to the affected component. Therefore, the vulnerability does not seem to impact resources beyond its security boundary, indicating a limited scope."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability enables information disclosure via manipulation of the API, suggesting that sensitive data managed by the system could be accessed or leaked. Since the description emphasizes that the manipulation leads to information disclosure, it implies that confidentiality of internal data, possibly including business or user information, is compromised. The potential for remote exploitation increases the risk of unauthorized access to confidential resources."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "There is no evidence from the description that the vulnerability allows modification, deletion, or corruption of data or system configurations. The focus is on information disclosure rather than data integrity. Therefore, the impact on integrity appears minimal or nonexistent, as the vulnerability does not facilitate unauthorized data alteration or system integrity breaches."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The description does not mention any service disruption, performance degradation, or resource exhaustion resulting from the vulnerability. Since the manipulation leads solely to information disclosure without indicating that it causes system crashes, denial of service, or resource depletion, the impact on availability is likely negligible or none."
