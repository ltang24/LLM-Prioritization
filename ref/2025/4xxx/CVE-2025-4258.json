No physical or local access is required. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)** | No special conditions or configurations are needed beyond sending a crafted request. The exploit is straightforward and publicly disclosed. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **Low (L)** | The attacker needs some level of access (e.g., authenticated user) to reach the upload endpoint, but not administrative privileges. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)** | The exploit does not require any user to perform an action. The attacker can trigger the vulnerability independently. |\n| **Scope (S)** | **Unchanged (U)** | The impact is confined to the vulnerable component (e.g., the web application). It does not affect other components or systems outside its security scope. |\n| **Confidentiality Impact (C)** | **Low (L)** | Unrestricted upload could allow attackers to upload files that expose sensitive data or enable access to internal resources, but not directly extract confidential data. |\n| **Integrity Impact (I)** | **Low (L)** | Attackers can upload arbitrary files, potentially altering the intended content or behavior of the application. |\n| **Availability Impact (A)** | **Low (L)** | While not explicitly stated, unrestricted uploads could lead to resource exhaustion (e.g., disk space), affecting availability. |\n\n---\n\n### ðŸ“Š CVSS Vector and Score\n\n- **Vector String**: `AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L`\n- **Base Score**: **6.3 (Medium)** [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2025-4258&version=3.1)\n\nThis score reflects a medium-severity vulnerability that is remotely exploitable with low complexity and limited impact across confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\nWould you like to explore how this score might change with different environmental or temporal factors?\n\n\n\n> [0] [NVD - CVSS v3 Calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2025-4258&version=3.1)",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in a web-accessible upload function within a Java-based controller. Exploitation involves sending a crafted HTTP request to the server with a manipulated 'imgFile' parameter, which does not require physical access or proximity to the target system. The attacker can initiate the exploit from any location with internet connectivity, provided the vulnerable endpoint is exposed. This remote accessibility significantly broadens the attack surface and allows exploitation without direct interaction with the host environment"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploit relies on the absence of validation or restrictions on the uploaded file type or content. There are no indications of required environmental conditions such as specific configurations, timing constraints, or race conditions. The attacker does not need to bypass any additional security mechanisms beyond exploiting the upload logic. The vulnerability is deterministic and repeatable, assuming the endpoint is reachable and the application version is affected. This simplicity reduces the need for specialized knowledge or circumstantial factors"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To exploit the upload functionality, the attacker must have access to the endpoint that processes file uploads. If this endpoint is publicly accessible without authentication, then no prior access credentials are needed. However, if the upload feature is gated behind a user session or role-based access control, the attacker would need to obtain minimal accessâ€”such as a basic user accountâ€”to reach the vulnerable code path. The exploit does not require administrative or elevated privileges to succeed"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not depend on any actions taken by a legitimate user. The attacker can directly interact with the vulnerable upload endpoint by sending a malicious request. There is no need for a user to click a link, open a file, or perform any behavior that would trigger the vulnerability. The compromise is fully initiated and executed by the attacker without requiring cooperation or presence of another human participant"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The scope of this vulnerability is unchanged. The unrestricted upload vulnerability in the MediaController.java file affects the component directly handling file uploads. Exploitation does not inherently cause a security boundary to be crossed or impact other components outside the immediate scope of the vulnerable component. The impact remains confined to the component where the vulnerability exists, without extending to other parts of the system or network"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The confidentiality impact is high. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can upload arbitrary files, potentially including malicious scripts or executables. If these files are executed or accessed, they could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within the application or on the server. This could result in significant data breaches, exposing confidential user data or system information"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The integrity impact is high. By uploading arbitrary files, an attacker can introduce malicious code or alter existing files. This could lead to the modification or corruption of critical data, defacement of web content, or insertion of backdoors. The ability to upload and potentially execute arbitrary files directly threatens the integrity of the system and its data"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The availability impact is high. Unrestricted file uploads can lead to resource exhaustion, such as disk space being filled with large or numerous files. Additionally, if malicious files are executed, they could disrupt services, crash the server, or render the application unusable. This can result in significant downtime and service interruptions, affecting the availability of the application and its resources"
