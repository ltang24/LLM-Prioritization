Attack Vector (AV)\n\n**Description:**  \nThe vulnerability involves manipulation of the argument `localPin` in the `/boafrm/formWsc` file, leading to a buffer overflow. The attack may be initiated remotely, and the exploit has been publicly disclosed.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network, without requiring physical access or local access to the device.\n- Since the attack can be initiated remotely, the attack vector is **Network (N)**.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**AV = Network (N)**\n\n---\n\n### 2. Attack Complexity (AC)\n\n**Description:**  \nThe vulnerability can be exploited remotely and publicly disclosed, implying that no complex conditions or special circumstances are required beyond sending a crafted request.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- Exploitation does not require any special conditions, user interaction, or complex setup.\n- It appears straightforward, assuming the attacker can send the malicious request.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**AC = Low (L)**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Privileges Required (PR)\n\n**Description:**  \nThe attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, likely without needing to authenticate or have any privileges on the device.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- Since the attack can be initiated remotely and no mention of authentication is made, it suggests **no privileges are required**.\n- The attacker can exploit the vulnerability as an unauthenticated user.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**PR = None (N)**\n\n---\n\n### 4. User Interaction (UI)\n\n**Description:**  \nThe attack is initiated remotely via crafted input; no indication that a user must participate or perform any action.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- No user interaction is necessary; the attacker can exploit the vulnerability directly.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**UI = None (N)**\n\n---\n\n### 5. Scope (S)\n\n**Description:**  \nThe vulnerability affects the device's processing of a specific file, leading to a buffer overflow. The description does not specify that the vulnerability impacts resources beyond the vulnerable component or that it can affect other security domains.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- Since the buffer overflow occurs within the device's own processing, and there's no indication that it affects other components or resources outside its scope, the scope remains **unchanged**.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Scope = Unchanged (U)**\n\n---\n\n### 6. Confidentiality Impact (C)\n\n**Description:**  \nThe vulnerability allows buffer overflow, which can lead to remote code execution or similar impacts. However, there's no explicit mention of data disclosure or confidentiality breach.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- Buffer overflows primarily threaten integrity and availability; unless the exploit explicitly leaks data, confidentiality impact is minimal.\n- No evidence suggests that confidential data is compromised.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**C = None (N)**\n\n---\n\n### 7. Integrity Impact (I)\n\n**Description:**  \nBuffer overflow vulnerabilities often allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially altering system state or data.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- Given the critical severity and buffer overflow, successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, affecting system integrity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**I = High (H)**\n\n---\n\n### 8. Availability Impact (A)\n\n**Description:**  \nBuffer overflows can cause crashes or denial of service, impacting availability.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The vulnerability can lead to system crashes or remote code execution, which would impact the device's availability.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**A = High (H)**\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics for CVE-2025-4462:**\n\n| Metric | Value | Reasoning |\n|---------|---------|------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)** | **Network (N)** | Exploitable remotely over the network. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)** | No special conditions required. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None (N)** | No authentication needed. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)** | No user participation needed. |\n| **Scope (S)** | **Unchanged (U)** | Affects only the vulnerable component. |\n| **Confidentiality Impact (C)** | **None (N)** | No explicit data disclosure. |\n| **Integrity Impact (I)** | **High (H)** | Potential for arbitrary code execution. |\n| **Availability Impact (A)** | **High (H)** | Can cause crashes or denial of service. |\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nGiven the critical severity and the nature of buffer overflow vulnerabilities, the overall CVSS score would likely be **9.8 (Critical)**, but the precise score depends on the vector string derived from these metrics.\n\n---\n\n**Final CVSS v3.1 Base Vector String:**  \n`AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H`\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis vulnerability is highly severe due to its remote exploitability, lack of required privileges or user interaction, and its potential to cause system crashes or remote code execution, impacting system integrity and availability.",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited over a network, as it involves the manipulation of a parameter in a web-based interface of the TOTOLINK N150RT router. This means an attacker can initiate the attack from a remote location without needing physical access to the device. The ability to exploit the vulnerability remotely significantly broadens the scope of potential attackers, as they do not need to be in close proximity to the device or connected to the same local network"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The conditions required to exploit this vulnerability are relatively straightforward, as the exploit has been publicly disclosed. This implies that the attacker does not need to bypass complex security measures or rely on specific environmental conditions that are beyond their control. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of input in a specific file, suggesting that the attacker only needs to craft a specific request to trigger the buffer overflow, without needing to manipulate other system configurations or dependencies"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerability description does not specify any need for the attacker to have prior access to the system or elevated privileges. This suggests that the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing to authenticate or possess any special permissions on the device. The attacker's ability to manipulate the 'localPin' argument remotely implies that no prior access or privilege escalation is necessary to initiate the exploit"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation of this vulnerability does not appear to require any action from a user other than the attacker. The description indicates that the attack can be initiated remotely by manipulating a specific argument, which suggests that the attack can be executed without needing a legitimate user to perform any actions, such as clicking a link or opening a file, to facilitate the exploitation process"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The CVSS v3.1 vector for CVE-2025-4462 specifies Scope as Unchanged (S:U), indicating that the buffer overflow vulnerability in the /boafrm/formWsc component does not cross security boundaries or affect other components outside its own security scope. The impact is confined to the vulnerable TOTOLINK N150RT firmware module, and exploitation does not result in privilege escalation or compromise of other system modules. Therefore, the vulnerability remains within the bounds of the affected component’s security authority"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVSS vector includes a High Confidentiality Impact (C:H), which suggests that successful exploitation of the buffer overflow could allow an attacker to read sensitive memory contents or access protected configuration data. Since the vulnerability is remotely exploitable and affects input processing of the localPin parameter, attackers may be able to manipulate memory to extract credentials, network configurations, or other private information stored in the device’s memory space. This poses a significant risk to the confidentiality of user data managed by the router"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The Integrity Impact is rated High (I:H), meaning the buffer overflow could allow attackers to overwrite memory or inject malicious code, thereby altering the behavior of the firmware. This could result in unauthorized changes to system settings, firmware corruption, or installation of persistent backdoors. The ability to manipulate the localPin argument and trigger memory corruption implies that attackers could compromise the integrity of the device’s operational logic and stored data"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Availability Impact is also rated High (A:H), indicating that exploitation of the buffer overflow could lead to denial-of-service conditions or complete device failure. By overflowing the buffer, attackers may crash the web interface or the underlying firmware, rendering the router inoperable until manually rebooted or re-flashed. This could disrupt network connectivity for all users relying on the device, making the vulnerability a serious threat to service availability"
