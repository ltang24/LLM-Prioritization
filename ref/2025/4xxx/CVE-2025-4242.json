      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited over a network connection without requiring physical access to the system or proximity. An attacker can initiate the attack remotely by sending specially crafted requests to the web application's endpoint, making it accessible from outside the local environment. Since the attack leverages standard web communication channels, it does not depend on local access or physical proximity, allowing exploitation from anywhere on the internet or within a network that can reach the server."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to craft specific input parameters that manipulate the application's input handling, particularly the 'fromdate' argument. This involves understanding the application's input validation and potentially bypassing any input sanitization measures. The attacker does not need to set up complex conditions or rely on particular system states; instead, they only need to send a malicious request with the appropriate parameter values. No additional configurations or environmental conditions are necessary beyond the ability to reach the application and craft the payload."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any existing privileges or authenticated access to the system to exploit this vulnerability. The attack targets an input parameter that is accessible to unauthenticated users or visitors, meaning the attacker can initiate the exploit without prior authorization or elevated permissions. Exploitation can occur directly through the web interface, making it accessible to any user who can send requests to the affected endpoint."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not require any action or participation from legitimate users of the system. The attacker can perform all necessary steps remotely by sending malicious requests without convincing or prompting other users to perform specific actions or interact with the system. The attack is fully automated from the attacker's side, and no human intervention or cooperation from other users is needed for successful exploitation."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides in the /admin/between-dates-report.php file and is triggered via manipulation of the 'fromdate' parameter, leading to SQL injection. Since the injection occurs within the database query context, it remains confined to the same security scope‚Äîthe web application and its backend database. There is no indication that exploitation affects other components outside the birth certificate system or crosses trust boundaries into unrelated systems. Therefore, the scope is considered unchanged, as the impact is limited to the component managing the vulnerable functionality"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection vulnerabilities often allow attackers to extract sensitive data from the backend database. In this case, the Online Birth Certificate System likely stores personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, birth dates, and parental details. Exploiting the 'fromdate' parameter could enable unauthorized access to these records, violating data confidentiality. Given the critical classification and public exploit availability, the risk of full database disclosure is high, justifying a high confidentiality impact rating"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "SQL injection not only enables data retrieval but can also allow modification of database contents. An attacker could potentially alter birth certificate records, insert fraudulent entries, or corrupt existing data. This undermines the trustworthiness of the system‚Äôs output and could have legal or administrative consequences. The ability to manipulate core data structures through unsanitized input indicates a high impact on data integrity, especially if no input validation or query parameterization is in place"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While SQL injection primarily targets data access and manipulation, it can also be used to disrupt service availability. Attackers may craft queries that lock tables, exhaust database resources, or trigger denial-of-service conditions. For example, injecting commands that cause long-running queries or recursive joins could degrade performance or crash the system. Given the remote exploitability and lack of input sanitization, the vulnerability poses a high risk to system availability through resource exhaustion or service interruption"
