        "content": "Sure! Here's a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2025-4759**, based on the official definitions and the nature of the vulnerability:\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 CVSS v3.1 Vector: `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L`  \n**Base Score: 8.3 (High)** [[0]](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4759)\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Metric Breakdown & Reasoning\n\n| Metric | Value | Justification |\n|-------|-------|---------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)** | **Network (N)** | Exploitation occurs via manipulation of package URLs in lockfiles, which are typically fetched or validated during package installation—often over a network. No physical or local access is required. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)** | The attack involves extending the package name to bypass validation. This does not require any special conditions or environmental setup beyond standard package installation. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **None (N)** | The attacker does not need any privileges on the target system. They can exploit the vulnerability by publishing a malicious package and tricking the system into installing it. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)** | No user interaction is needed once the malicious package is introduced. The vulnerability is triggered automatically during dependency resolution. |\n| **Scope (S)** | **Changed (C)** | The vulnerability allows the attacker to affect components beyond the vulnerable lockfile-lint-api itself—specifically, it can lead to installation of unintended packages, impacting other parts of the system. |\n| **Confidentiality (C)** | **Low (L)** | Installing unintended packages could expose sensitive data if the malicious package includes data exfiltration capabilities. However, this is indirect and not guaranteed. |\n| **Integrity (I)** | **Low (L)** | The integrity of the system is compromised by installing packages other than those intended, potentially altering expected behavior or introducing malicious code. |\n| **Availability (A)** | **Low (L)** | Malicious packages could degrade or disrupt application functionality, but there’s no indication of complete denial-of-service or system crash.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Summary\n\nThis vulnerability is particularly concerning because it undermines the trust model of package management systems. By bypassing validation, attackers can inject arbitrary packages, potentially leading to widespread compromise across systems that rely on automated dependency resolution.\n\nIf you'd like, I can also walk you through how this score compares to CVSS v4.0 or help you assess its impact in your specific environment.\n\n\n\n> [0] [NVD - CVE-2025-4759](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4759)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by manipulating the resolved attribute of a package URL during validation. Since this involves bypassing validation logic in the lockfile-lint-api, an attacker does not need physical access to the target system but can execute the attack over a network by providing a maliciously crafted package name"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The exploitation requires the attacker to craft a specific package name that exploits the early validation flaw in the resolved attribute. This does not depend on external environmental factors or complex configurations but does require the attacker to understand the validation logic and construct the input accordingly"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need elevated privileges on the target system to exploit this vulnerability. The issue lies in the validation process of the lockfile-lint-api, which can be triggered by providing a malicious input during normal usage of the package"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "Exploitation does not require any action from a user other than the attacker. The vulnerability is triggered by the malicious input provided by the attacker, and no additional user participation is necessary for the attack to succeed"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The scope is marked as 'Changed', indicating that successful exploitation of the vulnerability in the lockfile-lint-api component can affect resources beyond its own security authority. Specifically, by bypassing validation and installing unintended npm packages, an attacker can influence the behavior or integrity of other components that rely on the expected package structure. This cross-boundary impact justifies a changed scope, as the vulnerability allows manipulation of external dependencies or systems that consume the compromised package"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The confidentiality impact is rated 'Low', meaning that exploitation may result in limited information disclosure. In this case, the vulnerability allows installation of unintended packages, which could potentially expose metadata or configuration details of the system using those packages. However, it does not directly enable access to sensitive user data or system secrets. The risk is primarily indirect, such as leaking package resolution paths or dependency trees, rather than direct data exfiltration"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Integrity is rated 'Low' because the vulnerability permits modification of the expected package installation behavior. By bypassing validation, an attacker can substitute or inject malicious packages, altering the integrity of the software supply chain. While this does not corrupt existing data, it undermines the trust and correctness of the installed components, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution or tampered functionality. The impact is limited to the scope of package resolution and does not extend to core system data"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Availability is also rated 'Low', suggesting that exploitation may cause minor service degradation but not complete denial of service. Installing unintended packages could introduce performance issues, dependency conflicts, or runtime errors, which may affect the stability of applications relying on the lockfile-lint-api. However, the vulnerability does not directly consume excessive resources or crash the system, and recovery is typically possible through package correction or reinstallation"
