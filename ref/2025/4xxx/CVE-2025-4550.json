        "content": "### CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics Analysis for CVE-2025-4550\n\n#### **1. Attack Vector (AV): Network**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via manipulation of the `pid` parameter in the `/admin/pass-details.php` file. Since the attack can be initiated over a network without requiring physical access to the system, the **Attack Vector** is classified as **Network**.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Attack Complexity (AC): Low**\n- **Reasoning**: The description does not mention any special conditions or prerequisites that would make exploitation difficult. SQL Injection vulnerabilities typically do not require advanced knowledge or complex conditions to exploit. The attacker only needs to craft a malicious input for the `pid` parameter, making the **Attack Complexity** **Low**.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Privileges Required (PR): None**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication or privileges. The attacker does not need to log in or have any specific access to the system to manipulate the `pid` parameter. Therefore, **Privileges Required** is **None**.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. User Interaction (UI): None**\n- **Reasoning**: The attack does not require any interaction from a user (e.g., clicking a link or opening a file). The attacker can exploit the vulnerability directly by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint. Thus, **User Interaction** is **None**.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Scope (S): Unchanged**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability affects the same security scope as the vulnerable component (the web application). There is no indication that exploiting the vulnerability would lead to impacts on other components or systems beyond the web application itself. Therefore, **Scope** is **Unchanged**.\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Confidentiality Impact (C): High**\n- **Reasoning**: SQL Injection vulnerabilities often allow attackers to extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials, personal information, or other confidential records. Since the vulnerability could expose sensitive information, the **Confidentiality Impact** is **High**.\n\n---\n\n#### **7. Integrity Impact (I): High**\n- **Reasoning**: SQL Injection can also allow attackers to modify or delete data in the database, compromising its integrity. For example, attackers could alter records, inject malicious data, or corrupt the database. This results in a **High** impact on **Integrity**.\n\n---\n\n#### **8. Availability Impact (A): High**\n- **Reasoning**: SQL Injection can potentially disrupt the availability of the database or the application. For example, attackers could execute queries that lock tables, delete critical data, or crash the database server. This would render the application unavailable, leading to a **High** impact on **Availability**.\n\n---\n\n### **CVSS v3.1 Base Score Calculation**\nUsing the CVSS v3.1 formula and the metric values determined above:\n\n- **Attack Vector (AV): Network (0.85)**\n- **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (0.77)**\n- **Privileges Required (PR): None (0.85)**\n- **User Interaction (UI): None (0.85)**\n- **Scope (S): Unchanged**\n- **Confidentiality Impact (C): High (0.56)**\n- **Integrity Impact (I): High (0.56)**\n- **Availability Impact (A): High (0.56)**\n\n#### Base Score Calculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Impact} = 1 - [(1 - C) \\times (1 - I) \\times (1 - A)]\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Impact} = 1 - [(1 - 0.56) \\times (1 - 0.56) \\times (1 - 0.56)] = 1 - [0.44 \\times 0.44 \\times 0.44] = 1 - 0.085 = 0.915\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Exploitability} = AV \\times AC \\times PR \\times UI = 0.85 \\times 0.77 \\times 0.85 \\times 0.85 = 0.477\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Base Score} = \\text{if Impact ≤ 0, 0; otherwise:} \\\\\n\\text{Scope Unchanged:} \\\\\n\\text{Min[(Impact + Exploitability), 10]} = \\text{Min[(0.915 + 0.477), 10]} = 9.8\n\\]\n\n### **Final CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.8 (Critical)**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Metrics**\n| **Metric**               | **Value**     |\n|---------------------------|---------------|\n| **Attack Vector (AV)**    | Network       |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)**| Low           |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | None        |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | None          |\n| **Scope (S)**             | Unchanged     |\n| **Confidentiality (C)**   | High          |\n| **Integrity (I)**         | High          |\n| **Availability (A)**      | High          |\n| **Base Score**            | 9.8 (Critical)|",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerable script can be accessed by supplying crafted input through an HTTP request to a publicly reachable endpoint within the web application. Since the flaw exists in a file that handles administrative data processing and can be targeted via the manipulation of a URL parameter, exploitation is possible from outside the internal network, without requiring proximity to the server or local access. The attacker does not need physical access to the system hosting the application and can initiate the attack over the internet using commonly available tools"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "No unusual or highly specific environmental conditions are required to exploit the vulnerability. The attack relies solely on injecting malicious SQL syntax into a known input parameter ('pid') within a web application endpoint. Once the target script is located, a straightforward injection can be performed without depending on system misconfigurations, race conditions, or timing constraints. Moreover, publicly available exploit code significantly reduces the effort needed for successful exploitation, eliminating the need for trial-and-error or sophisticated setup"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need prior authentication or authorization to send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint. The injection occurs during unauthenticated access to a script handling administrative logic, and the input is not protected by access control. This allows the attacker to achieve exploitation without any role-based access or login credentials, and no interaction with protected resources is required before executing the malicious payload"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to compromise the application without requiring any action from legitimate users. The crafted malicious request can be executed entirely through the attacker's tooling without needing a user to click a link, download a file, or otherwise engage with the attacker. The process from payload submission to successful injection and potential data exfiltration is autonomous and self-contained, requiring no cooperation from a human user"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The CVSS v3.1 vector for CVE-2025-4550 specifies Scope as Unchanged (S:U), indicating that the impact of exploitation remains confined to the vulnerable component itself. The SQL injection vulnerability in /admin/pass-details.php allows manipulation of the 'pid' parameter, but there is no evidence that it affects other components or crosses trust boundaries. The attack does not appear to escalate privileges or compromise external systems beyond the Apartment Visitors Management System, thus maintaining the same security scope"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVSS v3.1 vector assigns a Low Confidentiality Impact (C:L), meaning limited information disclosure is possible. SQL injection vulnerabilities often allow attackers to extract data from backend databases. In this case, the 'pid' parameter likely references visitor pass details, which may include names, contact information, or visit history. While sensitive, this data is not classified as highly confidential (e.g., credentials or financial records), and the scope of exposure is likely limited to specific records rather than full database dumps"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The Integrity Impact is rated Low (I:L), suggesting that the attacker may be able to modify or corrupt some data, but not in a way that causes significant harm. SQL injection can allow unauthorized changes to database entries, such as altering visitor records or inserting misleading data. However, the vulnerability does not appear to enable full administrative control or systemic corruption of the application. The impact is constrained to specific fields or entries, and does not compromise the integrity of the entire system"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Availability Impact is also rated Low (A:L), meaning the vulnerability may cause minor service disruption but not complete denial of service. SQL injection could be used to craft queries that slow down the database or consume resources, potentially degrading performance. However, there is no indication that the vulnerability allows for persistent service outages, data deletion, or resource exhaustion. The system may remain operational with intermittent issues, and recovery would likely be straightforward once the malicious input is removed"
