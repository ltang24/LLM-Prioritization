While the privileges required are low and complexity is minimal, user interaction is essential for exploitation. The scope remains unchanged, and impacts are mostly related to potential content manipulation (low integrity impact) rather than data breach or service disruption.\n\nWant help calculating the full CVSS score or crafting a security advisory for it?",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can interact with the WordPress site over the internet. The attacker does not need to be physically present or on the same local network as the target system. The exploitation involves injecting malicious scripts into the plugin's shortcode, which can be done remotely through standard web requests to the site where the plugin is active"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability does not require any special conditions or configurations beyond what is typically present in a WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin. The attacker needs to craft a specific payload to inject into the shortcode, but no additional steps or rare conditions are necessary for the exploit to work. The process is straightforward for someone with knowledge of web scripting and WordPress plugins"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability. This means the attacker needs to be authenticated and have the ability to create or edit posts where the malicious shortcode can be injected. Without these privileges, the attacker cannot insert the malicious content needed to trigger the vulnerability"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "For the malicious script to execute, a user other than the attacker must visit a page or post where the injected shortcode is present. This means that user interaction is necessary for the payload to be triggered, as the script runs in the context of the user's browser when they access the compromised content"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in the WZ Followed Posts plugin has a changed scope because it allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users, such as administrators or visitors. This crosses a security boundary, as the malicious code impacts resources beyond the plugin itself, including the broader WordPress site and potentially the browser environment of affected users. The exploitation affects components outside the plugin's intended security scope, such as the WordPress core and user sessions"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The confidentiality impact is significant because the injected scripts can access sensitive data within the context of the affected user. For example, if an administrator views an injected page, the script could steal session cookies, authentication tokens, or other private information. This could lead to unauthorized access to the WordPress site or other sensitive resources"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The integrity impact is high because the vulnerability allows attackers to modify the content of pages by injecting arbitrary scripts. This could result in defacement of the website, unauthorized changes to displayed content, or the introduction of malicious functionality that could further compromise the system or mislead users"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The availability impact is limited to moderate. While the injected scripts themselves do not directly disrupt the availability of the plugin or the WordPress site, they could be used to perform actions like resource-intensive operations or denial-of-service attacks on the client side, potentially degrading performance or causing crashes for users accessing the affected pages"
