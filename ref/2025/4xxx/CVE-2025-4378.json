      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability resides within a mobile application that communicates over the network, potentially transmitting sensitive information in cleartext and relying on hard-coded credentials. An attacker must be able to interact with the mobile app's network communication channel, which typically involves either convincing the user to connect to a malicious network or intercepting traffic on an insecure connection. Exploitation can occur remotely as the attacker does not need physical access to the device but requires the ability to send malicious data or intercept communications during normal app usage. Therefore, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without physical proximity to the device, provided they can influence or observe the network traffic."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability requires conditions beyond the attacker's direct control, such as the presence of insecure transmission protocols that send sensitive information in plaintext, or the existence of hard-coded credentials within the application code. The attacker must be able to induce or observe network traffic between the mobile app and its backend services, which may involve setting up a man-in-the-middle position or convincing the user to connect to a malicious network. No specialized configurations or complex setups are necessary beyond the typical scenario of intercepting or manipulating network communications, making the exploitation straightforward if the network environment is insecure."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker does not need any prior access privileges on the target device or application. They can leverage the vulnerability through network-based attacks without authenticating or gaining any form of user-level access to the device or application. The attacker’s actions are limited to sending malicious network traffic or intercepting unencrypted communications, which do not require elevated privileges or prior authentication within the app or device. Consequently, the attacker operates without any privileges on the target system."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "Exploitation of this vulnerability does not necessitate any action or participation from the user beyond normal application usage. The attacker’s malicious activity can be carried out passively by intercepting or manipulating network traffic during regular app operation. The user does not need to perform any specific actions, such as clicking links or opening files, for the attack to succeed. The vulnerability’s nature allows an attacker to compromise the application’s security simply by observing or intercepting network communications during typical use, without requiring user involvement."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability in the ATA-AOF Mobile Application primarily affects the application itself, but due to the nature of authentication bypass, it could potentially impact other components or systems that rely on this application for secure access. If the application is integrated with other systems, unauthorized access could extend to those systems, crossing security boundaries and affecting their resources. Thus, the scope is likely changed as exploitation could impact resources beyond the immediate application, especially if it interfaces with other university systems or databases"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The use of cleartext transmission and hard-coded credentials significantly compromises confidentiality. Sensitive information, such as user credentials or personal data, could be intercepted during transmission. Unauthorized users could exploit these weaknesses to gain access to confidential information managed by the application. This vulnerability allows attackers to view sensitive data that should be protected, leading to a high confidentiality impact"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows for authentication bypass, which means attackers could potentially alter or manipulate data within the application. If an attacker gains unauthorized access, they could modify user data, application settings, or other critical information, compromising the integrity of the data. This could lead to misinformation, unauthorized changes, or corruption of data, indicating a significant impact on integrity"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "While the primary focus of the vulnerability is on confidentiality and integrity, the availability of the application could also be indirectly affected. Unauthorized access might lead to resource misuse or denial of service if attackers exploit the system for malicious purposes. However, the direct impact on availability is less pronounced compared to confidentiality and integrity, but potential service disruption or performance degradation cannot be entirely ruled out"
