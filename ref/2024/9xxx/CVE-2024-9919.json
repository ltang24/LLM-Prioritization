      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability exists within a web-based API endpoint that is accessible over the network, allowing an attacker to send crafted requests directly to the server hosting the application. Since the endpoint is exposed via standard network protocols and does not require physical access or local system interaction, an attacker can exploit it remotely without needing physical proximity or local system access."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploitation requires the attacker to craft a specific HTTP request targeting the vulnerable API endpoint. No additional complex conditions, such as specialized configurations, timing, or environmental prerequisites, are necessary beyond the ability to communicate with the server over the network. The absence of authentication checks simplifies the attack, making exploitation straightforward once network access is established."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any prior user privileges or authenticated access to the system. Since the endpoint does not verify client identity or permissions before executing directory deletion commands, the attacker can perform the malicious action without possessing any user privileges or elevated rights on the system. The attack leverages a missing access control mechanism rather than privilege escalation."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attack does not require any action or participation from legitimate users of the system. The attacker can independently send malicious requests to the vulnerable endpoint without convincing or involving other users. There is no need for a user to open a malicious link, execute a payload, or perform any activity that facilitates the attack; the process is fully automated from the attacker's side."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows attackers to delete directories on the server without proper authentication, which directly impacts the affected component's resources. Since the attack involves unauthorized manipulation of the server's filesystem, it crosses the security boundary of the specific API endpoint. This impact extends beyond the intended scope of the component, potentially affecting other system resources and services that rely on the affected directories, thus impacting resources beyond the initial component."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability primarily enables directory deletion without authentication, which does not inherently involve access to sensitive data or disclosure of confidential information. Since no information is accessed or leaked during the attack, the confidentiality of information resources managed by the component remains unaffected. Therefore, the confidentiality impact is minimal or none."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The ability to delete directories without proper authorization directly compromises the integrity of the filesystem and the data stored within those directories. Attackers can modify the system state by removing critical files or configurations, leading to potential corruption or loss of data integrity. This unauthorized modification undermines the trustworthiness and correctness of the system's data and operational state."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Unauthorized directory deletion can cause service disruption by removing essential files or components required for the application's operation. Such actions can lead to system crashes, degraded performance, or complete service outages, thereby significantly impacting the availability of the affected component. The attack exploits the lack of authentication to impair system functionality and availability."
