      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker through a crafted HTML page delivered over the internet. This means the attacker does not need physical proximity or direct access to the victim's device. The exploitation occurs via a web browser, making it accessible from virtually anywhere as long as the victim accesses the malicious page"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The attacker must convince the victim to perform specific UI gestures, such as clicking or interacting with elements on the crafted HTML page. This adds a dependency on user behavior, but no additional environmental conditions, configurations, or prerequisites are required for the vulnerability to be exploited once the crafted page is accessed"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any prior access or privileges on the victim's device. Exploitation occurs entirely through the browser and relies on the victim's interaction with the crafted HTML page, meaning the attacker operates without needing to authenticate or escalate privileges on the target system"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The vulnerability requires the victim to engage with the crafted HTML page by performing specific UI gestures. This means the attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability without the victim's active participation, such as clicking or interacting with the malicious content"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The CVSS vector for CVE-2024-9961 specifies Scope: Unchanged (S:U), indicating that the vulnerability does not cause a security boundary to be crossed. The flaw resides within the ParcelTracking component of Google Chrome on iOS, and although it allows for heap corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution, the impact remains confined to the same security authority. That is, the attacker’s actions do not affect components outside the browser’s own process or privilege domain. Therefore, the vulnerability does not extend its impact to other system components or user contexts beyond Chrome’s own sandboxed environment"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The Confidentiality Impact is rated High (C:H), which means that successful exploitation could result in a total loss of confidentiality. In this case, the use-after-free vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Chrome browser. This could enable access to sensitive user data such as browsing history, session tokens, or stored credentials. Since the attacker can potentially read any data accessible to the browser process, the confidentiality of user information is significantly compromised"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The Integrity Impact is also rated High (I:H), reflecting the potential for a complete compromise of data integrity. Exploiting the use-after-free condition could allow an attacker to manipulate memory and execute arbitrary code, which in turn could modify browser behavior, inject malicious scripts, or alter stored data such as cookies or local storage. This level of access enables the attacker to tamper with the integrity of both the application and the data it processes, leading to unauthorized changes that could persist across sessions"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The Availability Impact is rated High (A:H), indicating that the vulnerability could lead to a complete denial of service of the affected component. Heap corruption resulting from a use-after-free condition can cause the browser to crash or behave unpredictably. If exploited repeatedly or in a targeted manner, this could render the browser unusable for the victim, especially if the attack is triggered through commonly visited websites. In severe cases, it could also lead to broader system instability if the browser is tightly integrated with other services"
