        "content": "Here’s a detailed CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics analysis for **CVE-2024-9997**, a memory corruption vulnerability in Autodesk AutoCAD’s `acdb25.dll` when parsing malicious DWG files [[0]](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-55gj-r32f-c39x) [[1]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2024-9997):\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 **Attack Vector (AV): Local (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: Exploitation requires the attacker to trick a user into opening a malicious DWG file on their local system. This implies **local access** to the target environment—either physical access or the ability to place a file on the system.\n- **Official Definition Fit**: The vulnerability is not exploitable over a network or adjacent network; it requires local interaction.\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability is triggered simply by parsing a crafted file. There are **no special conditions** or environmental factors that must exist beyond the attacker’s control.\n- **Official Definition Fit**: No additional configuration or timing constraints are needed, making exploitation straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**\n- **Reasoning**: The attacker does **not need any privileges** on the target system. The vulnerability is triggered in the context of the application parsing the file, not through elevated access.\n- **Official Definition Fit**: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without authentication or prior access.\n\n---\n\n### 👤 **User Interaction (UI): Required (R)**\n- **Reasoning**: A user must **open or interact with the malicious DWG file**, which is a prerequisite for exploitation.\n- **Official Definition Fit**: The vulnerability cannot be exploited without user involvement.\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability affects the **same security authority**—the code execution or data exposure occurs within the context of the AutoCAD process.\n- **Official Definition Fit**: There is no impact on other components or privilege boundaries.\n\n---\n\n### 🔒 **Confidentiality Impact (C): High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Successful exploitation may allow the attacker to **read sensitive data** from memory, potentially exposing confidential information.\n- **Official Definition Fit**: This represents a **total loss of confidentiality** within the affected process.\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 **Integrity Impact (I): High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: Arbitrary code execution implies the attacker can **modify data or behavior** of the application, leading to a complete compromise of integrity.\n- **Official Definition Fit**: The attacker can alter system or application data.\n\n---\n\n### 🚫 **Availability Impact (A): High (H)**\n- **Reasoning**: The vulnerability can cause a **crash or denial of service**, and potentially more severe disruption if arbitrary code is executed.\n- **Official Definition Fit**: This is a **total loss of availability** for the affected component.\n\n---\n\n### 🧮 **Resulting Vector String**\n```\nCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n```\n\n### 📊 **Base Score: 7.8 (High)**\nThis score reflects a **high-severity vulnerability** due to the combination of no required privileges, high impact across CIA triad, and the need for user interaction [[1]](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2024-9997).\n\nLet me know if you’d like a breakdown of the Temporal or Environmental metrics too!\n\n\n\n> [0] [CVE-2024-9997 - GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-55gj-r32f-c39x)\n>\n> [1] [CVE-2024-9997 - Vulnerability Details - OpenCVE](https://app.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2024-9997)",

      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted DWG file is parsed by the AutoCAD application, specifically through the acdb25.dll component. This implies that the attacker must deliver the malicious file to the target system and have it opened within the vulnerable application. The exploitation does not require proximity to the physical machine, but it does require the file to be processed by the software, which could occur via email, download, or shared storage. Therefore, the attacker can initiate the exploit from a remote location, provided they can deliver the file to the target environment"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "The vulnerability arises from memory corruption during file parsing, which suggests that the exploit is deterministic once the malicious file is opened. There is no indication that the attacker must manipulate environmental conditions, race conditions, or specific system states beyond crafting the file correctly. The absence of external dependencies or unpredictable factors implies that the exploit can be reliably triggered under normal operating conditions, assuming the vulnerable component processes the file as expected"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process, which is typically the user running AutoCAD. There is no indication that the attacker must authenticate or possess elevated permissions prior to exploitation. The exploit occurs during file parsing, which is a standard operation for any user of the application. Therefore, the attacker does not need to compromise an account or escalate privileges beforehand to trigger the vulnerability"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "Successful exploitation depends on the target user opening or otherwise causing the vulnerable application to parse the malicious DWG file. This action cannot be performed by the attacker alone and requires the cooperation—intentional or unintentional—of a human user. The vulnerability is not triggered automatically upon file delivery; it necessitates that the file be actively processed by the application, which typically involves user engagement such as double-clicking the file or opening it from within the software"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The CVSS vector for CVE-2024-9997 specifies Scope as Unchanged (S:U), meaning the vulnerability's impact is confined to the vulnerable component itself—acdb25.dll within Autodesk AutoCAD. Although arbitrary code execution is possible, it occurs within the same security boundary and does not inherently affect other components or systems outside AutoCAD. There is no indication that exploitation crosses privilege boundaries or impacts external resources, so the scope remains unchanged."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially write sensitive data or execute arbitrary code, which implies a high risk to confidentiality (C:H). If exploited, the attacker could access or exfiltrate sensitive information processed by AutoCAD, such as proprietary design files or embedded metadata. Since the attack occurs in the context of the current process, any data accessible to that process is at risk of unauthorized disclosure."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "This vulnerability poses a high integrity impact (I:H) because arbitrary code execution enables an attacker to modify or corrupt data handled by AutoCAD. The attacker could alter DWG files, inject malicious content, or tamper with application behavior. Such unauthorized modifications compromise the trustworthiness of the data and could lead to downstream errors in engineering or architectural workflows."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can cause a crash or memory corruption, which directly affects the availability of the AutoCAD application (A:H). Exploitation may lead to denial of service, preventing users from accessing or using the software. Additionally, repeated exploitation could degrade performance or consume system resources, making the application unstable or unusable during critical operations."
