      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who is not physically present on the target system and does not require access to a local network. The attacker can send malicious requests over the internet to the vulnerable system, specifically targeting a query parameter in the LINE Campaign Module of the AIM LINE Marketing Platform. This indicates that the attacker can initiate the exploit from a remote location using standard web communication protocols, such as HTTP or HTTPS, without needing any direct access to the system's physical or internal network environment"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "There are no indications of special conditions or environmental factors that must be met for exploitation to succeed. The vulnerability arises from improper validation of a query parameter, and the attacker can inject arbitrary FetchXml commands directly. This suggests that exploitation does not depend on race conditions, specific timing, or complex system states. The only prerequisite appears to be that the LINE Campaign Module is enabled, which is a configuration choice rather than an unpredictable or difficult-to-achieve condition. Therefore, the exploit path is straightforward once the module is active"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need to authenticate or possess any form of user account on the system to exploit the vulnerability. The description explicitly states that the attack can be carried out by unauthenticated users, meaning that no prior access or credentials are necessary. The attacker can interact with the vulnerable endpoint directly from an external location, without needing to escalate privileges or gain access to any protected resources beforehand. This significantly lowers the barrier to exploitation"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not require any action from a legitimate user of the system. The attacker can execute the malicious payload independently by crafting and sending a request with the malicious FetchXml query. There is no indication that a user must click a link, open a file, or perform any other interaction to trigger the vulnerability. The entire attack can be carried out autonomously by the attacker without relying on social engineering or user cooperation"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary FetchXml commands into the AIM LINE Marketing Platform when the LINE Campaign Module is enabled. Since these commands can directly interact with the database, the exploitation impacts the underlying database component, which is beyond the scope of the initial application layer. This cross-component impact signifies a scope change, as the attack affects resources outside the immediate security boundary of the vulnerable component, potentially compromising other parts of the system that rely on the database."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability permits attackers to read sensitive database content through injection of FetchXml commands, which can include queries to retrieve confidential data stored within the platform. This unauthorized access to data resources compromises confidentiality, as sensitive information such as user data, campaign details, or other protected content can be disclosed without authorization, leading to potential data breaches."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "By exploiting the SQL Injection vulnerability, attackers can modify, delete, or corrupt database records via injected FetchXml commands. This ability to alter stored data directly impacts the integrity of the information managed by the platform. Such modifications can undermine data accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness, potentially disrupting business processes or causing data corruption."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The injection of arbitrary commands can lead to resource exhaustion, database crashes, or service interruptions if malicious queries are designed to delete or heavily modify data. This can result in denial of service, rendering the platform or specific functionalities unavailable to legitimate users. The potential for destructive database operations also poses a risk to the overall availability of the affected system components."
