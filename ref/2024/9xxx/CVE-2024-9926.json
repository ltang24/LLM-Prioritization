No physical or local access is needed. |\n| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | **Low (L)** | No special conditions or configurations are required. Any authenticated user can exploit it using a simple API call. |\n| **Privileges Required (PR)** | **Low (L)** | The attacker must be logged in as a subscriber (a low-privilege role), but no elevated permissions are needed. |\n| **User Interaction (UI)** | **None (N)** | The attack does not require any action from another user. The attacker initiates the API call independently. |\n| **Scope (S)** | **Unchanged (U)** | The vulnerability affects only the Jetpack plugin and does not impact other components or systems. |\n| **Confidentiality Impact (C)** | **Low (L)** | Unauthorized access to feedback data may expose sensitive user-submitted information, but it’s limited in scope. |\n| **Integrity Impact (I)** | **None (N)** | The vulnerability does not allow modification of data—only read access is possible. |\n| **Availability Impact (A)** | **None (N)** | There is no disruption or denial of service; the system remains fully operational. |\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Summary\nThis vulnerability allows **low-privilege authenticated users** to access **private feedback data** submitted via Jetpack’s contact form. While it doesn’t compromise system integrity or availability, it does pose a **moderate confidentiality risk**, especially for sites handling sensitive user communications.\n\nWant help calculating the Temporal or Environmental metrics next?\n\n\n\n> [0] [CVE-2024-9926 - Exploits & Severity - Feedly](https://feedly.com/cve/CVE-2024-9926)",

      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is exploitable through a REST API endpoint exposed by the Jetpack plugin. Since REST APIs are typically accessible over HTTP(S), an attacker can initiate the exploit remotely using standard web protocols. The proof-of-concept demonstrates that the exploit can be executed from a browser console, indicating that the attacker does not need to be physically present or on the same local network as the target. This remote accessibility significantly broadens the potential attack surface, allowing exploitation from virtually anywhere with internet access."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "There are no indications of environmental conditions, timing constraints, or race conditions that must be met for successful exploitation. The attacker simply needs to be authenticated and issue a direct API call to the vulnerable endpoint. The proof-of-concept shows a straightforward fetch request to the endpoint, suggesting that no special configurations, unpredictable states, or additional components are required. This lack of external dependencies or mitigating factors implies that the exploit can be reliably executed under typical operating conditions."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerability requires the attacker to be logged in with a user account that has minimal permissions, such as a subscriber role. This means the attacker must already possess valid credentials or compromise an account with basic access. While this does not allow full administrative control, it does require more than complete anonymity. The attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability without first passing the authentication barrier, even if the required privileges are minimal and commonly granted to general users."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploit does not depend on any action from another user, such as clicking a link, opening a file, or interacting with a malicious interface. Once the attacker is authenticated, they can execute the API call independently without requiring any cooperation or behavior from other users. The proof-of-concept involves a direct invocation of the vulnerable endpoint, which can be performed autonomously by the attacker. Therefore, the success of the attack is entirely under the attacker’s control after login."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability affects the Jetpack plugin’s REST API endpoint, enabling any authenticated user—regardless of privilege level—to access feedback data intended to be protected. Although the attack occurs within the plugin's component, the impact extends beyond the intended access boundaries. Subscriber roles typically lack the permission to read feedback submissions, which are managed by administrators. This means the vulnerability breaches WordPress's role-based access controls, altering the security boundary defined by user roles and plugin configuration. Thus, Scope is considered 'Changed', as exploitation results in unauthorized access across privilege separation."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "Confidentiality is notably compromised since feedback submitted via Jetpack Contact Forms may contain private communication, personally identifiable information (PII), or sensitive user inquiries. By accessing these submissions without proper authorization, a low-privileged user can read all historical feedback entries, violating the confidentiality guarantees normally enforced by WordPress and the plugin. This unauthorized visibility of data designed to be private significantly undermines the protection of user information, particularly on sites collecting feedback from customers or visitors."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "There is no indication in the CVE description or proof of concept that the vulnerability allows modification or deletion of feedback data. The REST endpoint permits read-only access and does not expose functions for altering the content. Thus, the vulnerability does not affect the integrity of the data; unauthorized users cannot change or corrupt feedback submissions. Therefore, Integrity Impact is considered 'None', as the component’s data remains unchanged and reliable despite the exposure."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "There is no evidence that exploitation of this vulnerability affects the performance, uptime, or accessibility of the Jetpack plugin or the WordPress site. The unauthorized feedback reading occurs via a standard API call, which does not impose any significant processing load or denial-of-service condition. Since access is limited to reading data, service availability remains unaffected. Consequently, Availability Impact is assessed as 'None', reflecting that the plugin’s functional operations continue without degradation or disruption."
