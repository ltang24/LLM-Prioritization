      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the system remotely without requiring any network restrictions or proximity. Since the flaw involves accessing a functionality that does not enforce authentication, an attacker can initiate exploitation over the internet or any network interface accessible to the service, making the attack feasible from a remote location without physical access or local presence."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploiting this vulnerability does not depend on complex conditions or specific configurations beyond the presence of the unauthenticated functionality. The attacker only needs to send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint, which is accessible without additional steps, special permissions, or environmental prerequisites. No advanced techniques or multiple steps are necessary, indicating a straightforward attack process once access to the network is established."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "Since the vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication or user credentials, the attacker does not need any level of privileges beforehand. The attacker can initiate the attack as an unauthenticated user, meaning no elevated or specific permissions are required to trigger the flaw. The attack is effective solely based on the ability to send requests to the vulnerable functionality."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The exploitation process does not require any action or participation from other users or individuals within the system. The attacker can independently initiate the attack by sending malicious requests directly to the vulnerable endpoint. There is no need for a legitimate user to perform any action, such as clicking links or executing code, for the vulnerability to be exploited successfully."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The CVSS vector indicates Scope: Unchanged (S:U), meaning the vulnerability's impact is confined to the same security authority as the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerability allows attackers to obtain session cookies of any user within the same application context. Although this can lead to full account compromise, it does not cross into affecting other components or systems outside the application’s security boundary. Therefore, the vulnerability does not breach isolation between different security domains"
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The Confidentiality Impact is rated High (C:H) because the vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to retrieve any user's session cookie. Session cookies often contain authentication tokens or session identifiers that grant access to sensitive user data and application functionality. With access to these cookies, attackers can impersonate users, including potentially privileged accounts, and access confidential information such as personal data, internal records, or business-critical content. This represents a complete loss of confidentiality within the affected application"
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The Integrity Impact is also rated High (I:H). Once an attacker obtains a valid session cookie, they can impersonate the user and perform any actions that the user is authorized to do. This includes modifying or deleting data, submitting unauthorized transactions, or altering application state. If administrative users are compromised, the attacker could potentially change system configurations or user permissions, leading to widespread data corruption or unauthorized changes across the platform"
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "Availability Impact is rated High (A:H) because session hijacking can be used to disrupt legitimate user access. Attackers could terminate sessions, lock users out, or perform actions that degrade the system’s performance or stability. For example, they might initiate resource-intensive operations or delete critical data, leading to service outages. While the vulnerability does not directly exploit system resources, the indirect consequences of unauthorized access can significantly impair the availability of the application"
