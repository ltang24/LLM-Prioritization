      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTML page, which implies that the attacker can initiate the attack remotely by hosting the malicious page on a web server. Victims only need to access the page via a browser, making the exploitation possible over the internet without requiring physical proximity or access to the victim's device. This context highlights that the attacker does not need to be on the same network or have direct access to the victim's system to exploit the flaw"
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploitation of this vulnerability does not appear to require specific environmental conditions or configurations beyond the victim using a vulnerable version of the browser. The attacker only needs to create and host a malicious HTML page that triggers the flaw. There are no indications of additional dependencies, such as specific browser settings, plugins, or unusual system configurations, which simplifies the conditions for successful exploitation"
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The attacker does not need any prior access to the victim's system or elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability. The attack is initiated entirely through the victim's interaction with the crafted HTML page, and no authentication or pre-existing access to the browser or operating system is required for the attacker to execute the exploit"
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attack relies on the victim visiting the malicious HTML page, which constitutes direct user interaction. The user must actively navigate to or be tricked into accessing the page, such as through phishing emails, malicious links, or other social engineering tactics. Without this interaction, the vulnerability cannot be exploited"
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The CVSS vector string for CVE-2024-9958 includes 'S:U', indicating an unchanged scope. This means the vulnerability does not cross security boundaries or affect components outside the vulnerable PictureInPicture implementation in Chrome. The spoofing attack remains confined to the browser's UI layer and does not impact other system components or processes. Therefore, exploitation does not result in a scope change, and the security authority governing the vulnerable component remains unaffected."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVSS vector includes 'C:N', meaning no impact to confidentiality. UI spoofing via a crafted HTML page may deceive users visually, but it does not provide unauthorized access to sensitive data or allow attackers to read protected information. The attack manipulates the user interface without breaching data confidentiality boundaries, and no information managed by the browser or system is disclosed as a result of exploitation."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVSS vector includes 'I:L', indicating a low impact to integrity. UI spoofing can mislead users into interacting with deceptive elements, potentially causing unintended actions such as clicking on misleading buttons. However, the vulnerability does not allow direct modification of system files, browser configurations, or user data. The integrity impact is limited to superficial UI manipulation rather than substantive data corruption or unauthorized changes."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The CVSS vector includes 'A:N', meaning no impact to availability. The vulnerability does not cause service disruption, performance degradation, or resource exhaustion. UI spoofing affects visual presentation but does not interfere with the browser’s ability to function or deliver content. Users may be tricked, but the underlying service remains operational and responsive, with no denial-of-service characteristics observed."
