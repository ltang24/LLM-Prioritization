      },
      "Attack_Vector": {
        "Attack_Vector_Reasoning": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted requests to a publicly accessible web interface of the Enterprise Cloud Database. Since the flaw lies in improper validation of a page parameter, an attacker does not need to be physically present or connected to a local network. The exploitation can occur over standard internet protocols, allowing attackers to initiate the attack from any location with network connectivity to the target system."
      },
      "Attack_Complexity": {
        "Attack_Complexity_Reasoning": "Exploitation does not require any special environmental conditions or configurations beyond what is typically present in a default deployment. The attacker only needs to identify the vulnerable endpoint and craft a request with a manipulated parameter to trigger the file read. There are no indications of required race conditions, timing constraints, or dependencies on external systems, making the attack straightforward once the endpoint is known."
      },
      "Privileges_Required": {
        "Privileges_Required_Reasoning": "The vulnerability is accessible without authentication, meaning the attacker does not need to log in or possess any user credentials. The flaw resides in a publicly reachable component that processes input without verifying the identity or access level of the requester. This allows any external actor to exploit the issue without prior access to the system or elevated permissions."
      },
      "User_Interaction": {
        "User_Interaction_Reasoning": "The attack does not rely on any actions from a legitimate user of the system. There is no need for a user to click a link, open a file, or perform any operation that would facilitate exploitation. The attacker can execute the exploit independently by sending a crafted request directly to the vulnerable service, making the compromise fully automated from the attacker's side."
      },
      "Scope": {
        "Scope_Reasoning": "The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary system files through a path traversal flaw in the enterprise cloud database component. Since this exploit enables access to files outside the intended security boundary, it impacts resources beyond the component's original scope, potentially affecting other system components or data stores. Therefore, the scope is considered 'Changed' because the security boundary is crossed, impacting resources beyond the initial component."
      },
      "Confidentiality_Impact": {
        "Confidentiality_Impact_Reasoning": "The vulnerability permits attackers to read arbitrary system files, which may include sensitive configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data stored on the server. This unauthorized disclosure compromises the confidentiality of information resources managed by the system, leading to potential data breaches or exposure of sensitive information. Consequently, the confidentiality impact is 'High' due to the potential for significant information disclosure."
      },
      "Integrity_Impact": {
        "Integrity_Impact_Reasoning": "Since the vulnerability primarily allows reading of files without any mechanism to modify them, it does not directly impact the integrity of data or system components. There is no indication that attackers can alter or corrupt data through this flaw, so the integrity impact remains 'None'. The vulnerability's nature is limited to information disclosure rather than data modification."
      },
      "Availability_Impact": {
        "Availability_Impact_Reasoning": "The exploit involves reading arbitrary files, which does not inherently cause system crashes, service disruptions, or resource exhaustion. While the attack may lead to information leakage, it does not directly impair the availability of the database service or system resources. Therefore, the availability impact is considered 'None' or minimal, as the core service remains operational despite the breach."
