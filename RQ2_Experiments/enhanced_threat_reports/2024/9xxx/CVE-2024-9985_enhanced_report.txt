CVE-2024-9985 describes a critical vulnerability in Ragic’s Enterprise Cloud
Database platform, where the application fails to enforce proper validation of
uploaded file types, thereby allowing authenticated users with standard
privileges to upload malicious files such as webshells and execute arbitrary
code on the hosting server. The root cause lies in the absence of robust
server-side checks to restrict file uploads to safe MIME types or extensions,
enabling attackers to bypass superficial client-side filters and inject
executable scripts disguised as benign files. Once uploaded, these webshells can
be accessed remotely, granting the attacker command execution capabilities
within the server’s context. The exploitation process is technically trivial,
requiring no complex preconditions or environmental factors; the attacker simply
needs to authenticate as a regular user and upload a crafted payload through the
standard file upload interface. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over
the network, significantly broadening the attack surface, and does not require
any user interaction beyond the attacker’s own actions. The risk assessment
indicates severe consequences across all impact domains: confidentiality is
compromised as attackers can extract sensitive data such as configuration files,
database contents, and user credentials; integrity is at risk due to the
potential for file tampering, code injection, or unauthorized data manipulation;
and availability is threatened by the possibility of service disruption through
destructive commands or resource exhaustion. The vulnerability resides within
the same security scope, but the ability to execute arbitrary code effectively
escalates the attacker’s control over the entire application environment. In
real-world scenarios, this flaw could be exploited by insiders or external
actors who gain access to a low-privilege account, using the webshell to pivot
laterally, establish persistence, or deploy ransomware. Cloud-hosted
environments are particularly vulnerable due to their exposure and the potential
for multi-tenant impact. Mitigation requires immediate implementation of strict
server-side file validation mechanisms, including MIME type verification,
extension whitelisting, and content inspection. Administrators should also
restrict executable permissions in upload directories, monitor for anomalous
file activity, and apply web application firewalls to detect and block malicious
payloads. Patching the application to enforce secure upload logic is essential,
and organizations should audit user privileges to minimize unnecessary upload
rights. Based on the available metadata, technical analysis, and corroborated
evidence from TWCERT advisories, the confidence in this threat intelligence
assessment is high, with clear indicators of exploitability, impact, and
remediation pathways.
