CVE-2024-9934 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability identified
in the Wp-ImageZoom WordPress plugin versions up to and including 1.1.0, which
fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input before reflecting it
in the plugin’s output. This flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to craft a
malicious URL containing embedded JavaScript payloads that, when visited by a
high-privilege user such as a site administrator, results in the execution of
arbitrary scripts within the context of the victim’s browser session. The root
cause lies in the plugin’s inadequate input validation mechanisms, specifically
its failure to apply output encoding or contextual escaping to parameters echoed
back into the DOM, thereby enabling script injection through query string
manipulation. Exploitation requires user interaction, as the attack vector
depends on social engineering tactics to lure a privileged user into clicking or
loading the malicious URL. The attack is network-based and does not require any
authentication or elevated privileges on the part of the attacker, making it
highly accessible and low in complexity. While the vulnerability does not
directly compromise server-side resources or availability, it poses a
significant risk to confidentiality and integrity by enabling session hijacking,
token theft, or unauthorized administrative actions through impersonation. For
example, an attacker could send a phishing email to a WordPress admin containing
a link to a crafted URL that, when clicked, executes JavaScript to exfiltrate
cookies or perform administrative actions such as installing malicious plugins
or altering site content. Although the scope of the vulnerability is technically
unchanged in terms of system boundaries, the impact can extend beyond the plugin
itself due to the elevated privileges of the targeted user, potentially
affecting the broader WordPress environment. To mitigate this vulnerability,
administrators should immediately update or disable the Wp-ImageZoom plugin if a
patched version is unavailable. Web application firewalls (WAFs) can provide
temporary protection by filtering malicious query strings, and
security-conscious site owners should enforce strict Content Security Policies
(CSP) to reduce the risk of script execution. Additionally, educating
users—especially administrators—on the dangers of clicking unsolicited links and
implementing secure coding practices such as contextual output encoding are
critical long-term defenses. Based on the available technical evidence,
exploitation is straightforward and has a high likelihood of success in
real-world scenarios where user interaction can be reliably induced. Our
confidence in this assessment is high, supported by consistent behavioral
analysis of the plugin’s response to unsanitized input and the well-documented
nature of reflected XSS attack patterns.
