CVE-2024-9955 pertains to a use-after-free vulnerability within the
WebAuthentication component of Google Chrome versions prior to 130.0.6723.58,
which affects the browser's handling of web authentication processes. The root
cause stems from improper memory management in the handling of certain HTML or
scripting content, where the browser fails to correctly free memory associated
with authentication objects after use, leading to dangling pointers. An attacker
can craft a malicious HTML page that, when visited by a user, triggers the
use-after-free condition, resulting in heap corruption. Exploitation relies on
the attacker delivering this malicious content remotely, such as via a
compromised or malicious website, with the victim visiting the page; thus, the
attack vector is over the network, specifically through web browsing. The
exploitation process is relatively straightforward, requiring the attacker to
craft a specific HTML page that manipulates the browser’s rendering and
scripting engine to reproduce the vulnerability reliably, indicating a low
attack complexity. No privileges are necessary on the victim’s system prior to
exploitation, as the attack is initiated solely through web content, and the
attacker only needs the victim to visit the malicious page, making the
privileges required effectively none. User interaction is mandatory, as the
victim must actively visit or open the malicious webpage for the exploit to
succeed; this reliance on user action elevates the attack from purely remote to
semi-social in nature. The scope of the vulnerability remains within the browser
process, affecting only the WebAuthentication component without crossing
security boundaries or affecting other system resources, thus the scope is
unchanged. Regarding impact, the primary concern is heap corruption that can
lead to arbitrary code execution or browser crashes; however, the CVE
description emphasizes potential heap corruption without explicitly confirming
data disclosure or integrity violations, and impacts on confidentiality and
integrity are therefore considered low or none. The vulnerability's potential to
cause crashes or instability can impact availability, but since the description
does not specify a guaranteed denial of service, the impact on availability is
also considered low. The CVSS assessment, based on these technical details,
indicates a remote attack vector with low complexity, requiring no privileges,
and involving user interaction, with impacts mainly on the availability and
potential for code execution, but limited or no direct impact on confidentiality
or integrity. Exploitation scenarios in the real world could include malicious
websites designed to exploit this flaw, leading to browser crashes or remote
code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities, especially in targeted
attacks against high-value users or organizations. Mitigation strategies include
promptly updating Chrome to the fixed version 130.0.6723.58 or later, which
addresses the underlying memory management flaw; users should be advised to
avoid visiting untrusted or suspicious websites, disable or restrict JavaScript
execution where feasible, and employ security controls such as web filtering and
sandboxing to limit exposure. Additionally, deploying endpoint security
solutions capable of detecting anomalous browser behavior can help mitigate
potential exploitation attempts. Given the detailed analysis and the official
references, confidence in this threat intelligence is high, as the root cause,
exploitation mechanism, and impact are well-documented and corroborated by the
Chrome security update and issue tracker. Nonetheless, as with all browser
vulnerabilities, the actual risk depends on user behavior and the attacker’s
ability to craft convincing malicious content, but the technical foundation of
the exploit remains solid and well-understood.
