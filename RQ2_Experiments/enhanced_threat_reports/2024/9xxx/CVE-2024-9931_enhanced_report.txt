CVE-2024-9931 pertains to a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in the
Wux Blog Editor plugin for WordPress, affecting all versions up to and including
3.0.0 due to inadequate validation of the autologin token during the login
process. The root cause stems from the plugin's failure to properly verify the
token supplied during autologin, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious
request that bypasses the standard authentication flow and gains unauthenticated
administrative access. Exploitation relies on sending a specially crafted
network request over the internet, exploiting the missing validation mechanism,
which makes the attack vector remote and accessible from anywhere without
requiring local access or physical proximity. Since the attacker does not need
prior privileges, the attack requires no user interaction and can be executed
with minimal complexity, involving simply the transmission of a malicious
request that mimics legitimate autologin behavior. The scope of the impact
remains within the WordPress environment, as the vulnerability grants full
administrator privileges, leading to a high confidentiality impact by exposing
sensitive site data, user information, and configurations. The integrity of the
website is severely compromised, as an attacker can modify, delete, or inject
malicious content, alter site settings, or compromise user accounts, undermining
trustworthiness and data consistency. The availability of the affected site can
also be disrupted, as malicious actors could disable plugins, delete critical
content, or deploy resource-intensive malicious scripts, resulting in potential
service outages or degraded performance. Real-world exploitation scenarios could
involve attackers scanning for vulnerable sites, then exploiting the flaw
remotely by sending crafted HTTP requests to gain admin access, enabling them to
exfiltrate sensitive data, deface the site, or deploy malware. Mitigation
strategies include promptly updating the plugin to a patched version if
available, or removing the plugin until a secure release is issued, as well as
implementing network-level protections such as web application firewalls to
detect and block suspicious requests targeting the autologin endpoint.
Administrators should also review and revoke any compromised credentials,
monitor logs for unusual activity, and consider deploying additional
authentication controls or plugin hardening measures. Given the detailed
technical analysis, the vulnerability's root cause, exploitation mechanism, and
potential impact are well-supported by the available evidence, providing high
confidence in this threat assessment. The overall risk is significant, given the
ease of remote exploitation, the absence of required privileges, and the severe
consequences of unauthorized administrator access, emphasizing the urgency for
affected site owners to apply mitigations promptly.
