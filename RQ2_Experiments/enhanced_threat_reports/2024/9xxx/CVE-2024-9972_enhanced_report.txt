CVE-2024-9972 is a critical SQL Injection vulnerability affecting version 0 of
the ChanGate Property Management System, which permits unauthenticated remote
attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands into backend database queries,
thereby enabling full compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability
of stored data. The root cause lies in the improper neutralization of
user-supplied input within SQL statements, specifically a failure to sanitize or
parameterize inputs in web-facing components such as login forms or search
fields, allowing attackers to manipulate SQL syntax and execute unintended
commands. Exploitation is feasible over the network without requiring
authentication or user interaction, as the vulnerable endpoints are exposed to
unauthenticated users and process input autonomously. The attack complexity is
minimal, requiring only the crafting of malicious SQL payloads and delivery via
standard HTTP requests, with no need for special conditions or timing. The scope
of impact extends beyond the immediate vulnerable component, as successful
exploitation can influence other system modules reliant on the compromised
database, such as user management, financial records, or operational workflows.
In real-world scenarios, an attacker could exfiltrate sensitive tenant or
financial data, tamper with lease records, or delete critical operational
tables, potentially halting property management operations and causing
reputational and financial damage. To mitigate this vulnerability, organizations
should immediately apply any available patches from ChanGate, implement strict
input validation and output encoding, and enforce the use of parameterized
queries or stored procedures across all database interactions. Additionally,
deploying web application firewalls (WAFs) with SQLi detection capabilities and
conducting regular code audits can help prevent recurrence. Given the
straightforward exploitation path, the absence of required privileges, and the
severe impact across all security dimensions, this vulnerability represents a
high-priority threat. Our confidence in this assessment is high, based on
corroborated technical analysis from multiple trusted sources and alignment with
established CVSS evaluation criteria.
