CVE-2024-9949 describes a high-severity vulnerability affecting Forescout
SecureConnector version 11.1.02.1019 on Windows systems, where an unprivileged
user can intentionally corrupt the application's configuration file, leading to
a denial of service that renders the SecureConnector application unresponsive or
crashes. The root cause stems from insecure default initialization of resources
within the application, classified under CWE-1188, which permits an attacker
with local access to manipulate configuration data without requiring elevated
privileges. Exploitation hinges on the attacker’s ability to access and modify
the configuration file directly, which can be achieved through standard
user-level interactions, making the attack straightforward and low in
complexity. Since the attack does not necessitate privilege escalation, user
interaction, or complex conditions, it can be executed by an unprivileged user
with minimal effort, provided they have access to the system environment. The
vulnerability's scope remains confined to the affected application, with no
indication of cross-component or system-wide impact, and it does not compromise
confidentiality or data integrity beyond corrupting the configuration resource;
the primary impact is a complete denial of service, severely affecting the
application's availability. Attackers could exploit this flaw in real-world
scenarios by gaining local access to a Windows host running the vulnerable
SecureConnector, then corrupting its configuration file—potentially through
malicious scripts, compromised user accounts, or insider threats—resulting in
service outages that disrupt network security functions reliant on the
application. Mitigation strategies include implementing strict access controls
to prevent unauthorized file modifications, applying the latest patches or
updates from Forescout that address this specific flaw, and ensuring that system
and application permissions restrict configuration file access to trusted
administrators only. Additionally, deploying host-based intrusion detection and
monitoring tools can help identify suspicious modifications or access patterns.
Given the detailed technical reasoning, the confidence in this threat assessment
is high, supported by official vulnerability disclosures, CVSS metric
derivations, and the documented root cause analysis, though ongoing monitoring
for potential exploits in the wild remains prudent as further exploitation
techniques or related vulnerabilities could emerge.
