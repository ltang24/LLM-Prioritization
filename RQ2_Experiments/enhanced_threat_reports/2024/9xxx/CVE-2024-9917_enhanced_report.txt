CVE-2024-9917 is a critical deserialization vulnerability affecting HuangDou
UTCMS version 9, specifically targeting an obscure segment within the file
app/modules/ut-template/admin/template_creat.php. The root cause stems from
improper handling of user-supplied input during the deserialization process,
which enables attackers to manipulate the 'content' argument to craft malicious
serialized payloads that are subsequently deserialized by the application. This
flaw arises because the application does not adequately validate or sanitize the
serialized data before deserialization, allowing an attacker to inject crafted
objects that can execute arbitrary code or trigger other malicious behaviors
upon deserialization. Exploitation is feasible remotely, as the vulnerability
can be triggered through standard HTTP requests that supply malicious serialized
data via the affected parameter, with attack complexity considered low due to
the straightforward nature of the payload delivery and the absence of robust
input validation. The attack vector involves sending specially crafted
serialized objects through the vulnerable endpoint, which, upon deserialization,
can lead to remote code execution, privilege escalation, or server compromise,
especially if the deserialized objects are configured to invoke dangerous
functions or manipulate internal application logic. In real-world scenarios,
threat actors could exploit this vulnerability to gain persistent access,
exfiltrate sensitive data, or deploy malware within targeted environments,
particularly in web applications relying on HuangDou UTCMS V9 for content
management. Mitigation requires immediate application of patches or updates from
the vendor, if available, or implementing strict input validation and
serialization controls to prevent malicious payloads from reaching the
deserialization process. Developers should avoid deserializing untrusted data
and consider employing safer serialization formats or mechanisms that do not
execute code during deserialization. Additionally, deploying Web Application
Firewalls (WAFs) with rules designed to detect and block malicious serialized
payloads can provide an extra layer of defense. Given the public disclosure of
the exploit and the lack of vendor response, confidence in the current threat
landscape is high, as threat actors are likely to develop and deploy exploit
code rapidly, increasing the risk of widespread exploitation. The
vulnerabilityâ€™s severity is amplified by its remote exploitability, the
potential for severe impact through remote code execution, and the widespread
deployment of affected versions, making it imperative for organizations using
HuangDou UTCMS V9 to prioritize immediate review, patching, and enhanced
monitoring of their systems to mitigate the risk of exploitation.
