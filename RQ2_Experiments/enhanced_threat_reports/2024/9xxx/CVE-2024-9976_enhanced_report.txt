CVE-2024-9976 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability affecting version 1.0 of
the code-projects Pharmacy Management System, specifically impacting the
/php/manage_customer.php?action=search endpoint. The root cause of this
vulnerability stems from improper input sanitization within the server-side
script, where user-supplied parameters, notably the 'text' argument, are
directly embedded into SQL queries without adequate validation or
parameterization. This flaw allows an attacker to manipulate the input to craft
malicious SQL payloads, which are then executed by the database engine, enabling
the attacker to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, modify or delete
records, or even escalate privileges within the application environment. The
exploitation mechanism involves sending crafted HTTP requests with specially
crafted 'text' parameter values that contain SQL injection payloads; because the
application does not sanitize or parameterize these inputs, the malicious SQL
commands are executed, leading to potential data breaches or system compromise.
From a risk perspective, this vulnerability presents a high severity due to its
remote exploitability, the ability to execute arbitrary SQL commands, and the
potential for significant data exposure or manipulation without requiring
authentication. The attack vector is remote, requiring only network access to
the vulnerable endpoint, and the attack complexity is low, as exploiting the
flaw involves straightforward injection techniques without the need for advanced
skills or bypassing multiple security controls. In real-world scenarios,
malicious actors could exploit this vulnerability to harvest sensitive customer
data, including personal information and transaction histories, which could then
be used for fraud, identity theft, or further targeted attacks. For instance, an
attacker might automate requests to extract entire customer databases or
manipulate records to conceal fraudulent activities. Mitigation involves
promptly applying patches or updates provided by the vendor, which should
include parameterized queries or input validation routines to prevent injection,
as well as implementing web application firewalls with rules tailored to detect
and block SQL injection attempts. Additionally, disabling or restricting access
to the vulnerable endpoint, enforcing least privilege principles on database
accounts, and conducting regular security audits can significantly reduce risk.
Developers should review and refactor the affected code to adopt secure coding
practices, such as prepared statements and input validation, to prevent future
injection flaws. Given the public disclosure of the exploit and the
straightforward nature of the attack, confidence in this intelligence is high,
supported by the detailed vulnerability description, public references, and the
known technical root cause. Overall, organizations utilizing this version of the
Pharmacy Management System should prioritize immediate remediation efforts to
prevent potential data breaches and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of
their systems and customer data.
