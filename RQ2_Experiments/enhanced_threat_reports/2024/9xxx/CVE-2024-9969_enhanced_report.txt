CVE-2024-9969 pertains to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
present in the outdated WebEIP version 3.0 developed by NewType, which no longer
receives maintenance or security updates. The core issue stems from improper
validation and sanitization of user input within specific parameters of the web
application, enabling an attacker to embed malicious JavaScript code that, when
reflected back to the victim, executes within the context of their browser.
Exploitation hinges on the attacker delivering a crafted URL containing
malicious payloads, which a victim must then visit or interact with, making the
attack reliant on user interaction. The root cause is a failure in input
validation logic, allowing unfiltered input to be embedded directly into web
responses without proper neutralization, thus enabling script injection. The
attack leverages the server’s handling of HTTP requests, where the server
reflects unsanitized input back to the client, facilitating the injection of
malicious scripts that execute in the victim’s browser. This mechanism does not
require elevated privileges beyond standard user access, but the attacker must
have access to the web interface with regular privileges, and the victim must
interact with the malicious link, making the attack scenario akin to phishing or
social engineering campaigns. The attack vector is over the network, exploiting
standard web protocols, and the exploitation complexity is low, as it involves
straightforward crafting of malicious URLs without reliance on complex
conditions or environment-specific configurations. The scope of impact is
changed, as the attack affects the user’s browser environment, potentially
enabling session hijacking, cookie theft, or manipulation of displayed content,
but does not directly compromise server data or system integrity. The
confidentiality impact is limited to information accessible within the victim’s
browser session, such as session tokens or cookies, which could be exploited for
impersonation or session hijacking. The integrity impact is similarly
constrained to client-side content manipulation, with no direct alteration of
server data or core system files. The availability of the system remains
unaffected, as the attack does not cause resource exhaustion or service
disruption. In real-world scenarios, this vulnerability could be exploited via
phishing campaigns where users are lured into clicking malicious links, leading
to session hijacking or data theft, especially in environments where users are
unaware of the embedded scripts. Mitigation involves upgrading to a supported
and maintained version of the product that incorporates robust input validation
and sanitization mechanisms, or applying web application firewall (WAF) rules to
filter malicious payloads. Additionally, deploying security headers such as
Content Security Policy (CSP) can restrict script execution, and educating users
about phishing risks can reduce successful exploitation. Since the affected
product is no longer maintained, organizations should prioritize migrating to
newer, supported platforms with secure coding practices. The confidence in this
threat intelligence is high, given the detailed vulnerability description, root
cause analysis, and corroborative references from authoritative sources, which
collectively confirm the nature of the flaw, its exploitation mechanism, and
recommended remediation strategies.
