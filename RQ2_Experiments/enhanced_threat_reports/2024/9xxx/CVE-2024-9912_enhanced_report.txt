The vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-9912 affects the D-Link DIR-619L B1
router running firmware version 2.06, specifically within the function
formSetQoS located in the file /goform/formSetQoS. This critical vulnerability
arises from improper handling of the curTime argument, leading to a buffer
overflow condition. The root cause of this issue is the lack of bounds checking
on the input data, which allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and
potentially execute arbitrary code on the device. The exploitation mechanism
involves remotely sending a specially crafted request to the vulnerable
function, which manipulates the curTime parameter to exceed the allocated buffer
size, thereby overwriting adjacent memory and enabling the execution of
malicious code. The risk assessment of this vulnerability is high due to several
factors: the attack can be initiated remotely without requiring physical access
to the device, the complexity of the attack is low as it does not require
advanced skills or significant resources, and the potential impact includes
complete compromise of the affected device, allowing attackers to gain control
over network traffic, steal sensitive information, or use the device as a pivot
point for further attacks. In real-world scenarios, this vulnerability could be
exploited by attackers to infiltrate home or small office networks, intercept
and manipulate data, or launch further attacks on connected devices. Mitigation
and remediation involve updating the router firmware to a version that addresses
this vulnerability, if available. Additionally, network administrators should
implement network segmentation to limit the exposure of vulnerable devices and
apply strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access. Disabling the
affected QoS feature or restricting access to the router's management interface
to trusted IP addresses can also reduce the risk of exploitation. Our confidence
in this intelligence is high, based on the public disclosure of the exploit and
the detailed technical analysis available from multiple reputable sources. The
vulnerability has been confirmed and documented extensively, providing a clear
understanding of the threat and its implications.
