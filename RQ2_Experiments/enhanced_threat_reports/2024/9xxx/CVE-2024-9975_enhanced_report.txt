CVE-2024-9975 pertains to a critical vulnerability in the SourceCodester Drag
and Drop Image Upload version 1.0, which affects the specific functionality
within the upload.php script responsible for handling image uploads. The core
issue stems from insufficient validation and sanitization of user-supplied files
during the upload process, allowing attackers to exploit an unrestricted upload
flaw. Technically, the root cause lies in the server-side logic that fails to
properly verify the file type, size, or content, thereby permitting malicious
files—such as PHP scripts or other executable payloads—to be uploaded without
restriction. This flaw enables an attacker to craft a malicious file that, once
uploaded, can be executed on the server, potentially leading to remote code
execution (RCE). The exploitation mechanism typically involves an attacker
submitting a crafted payload disguised as an image, exploiting the lack of
validation to bypass security controls, and then executing the payload via
direct URL access or through other server-side triggers. The attack vector is
remote, requiring only network access to the vulnerable upload endpoint, and the
complexity is relatively low, as the attack does not demand advanced techniques
beyond crafting a malicious file and submitting it through the upload interface.
In real-world scenarios, this vulnerability could be exploited by threat actors
to deploy web shells, establish persistent backdoors, or pivot into internal
network segments, especially if the affected application is exposed to the
internet without additional security controls. For instance, an attacker could
upload a PHP web shell disguised as an image, then leverage it to execute
arbitrary commands on the server, escalate privileges, or compromise other
connected systems. Mitigation strategies include implementing strict server-side
validation that enforces file type checks, restricting upload permissions to
only necessary directories, disabling execution of uploaded files in directories
meant for storage, and employing security headers and Web Application Firewall
(WAF) rules to detect and block malicious upload attempts. Additionally,
updating the application to incorporate robust validation routines, such as MIME
type verification, file extension whitelisting, and content inspection, is
critical. Applying security patches provided by the vendor or developing custom
validation logic can significantly reduce the attack surface. It is also
advisable to monitor server logs for unusual upload activity and to restrict
access to the upload functionality to authenticated and authorized users only.
Given the public disclosure of this vulnerability and the availability of
exploit code, confidence in the threat intelligence is high, as the
vulnerability has been confirmed, and exploitation techniques are
well-documented and accessible. Nonetheless, the actual risk level depends on
the exposure of the affected system and the presence of existing security
controls; environments with proper validation, segmentation, and monitoring are
less susceptible to successful exploitation. Overall, CVE-2024-9975 presents a
severe security risk that demands immediate attention, especially for
organizations running the vulnerable version 1.0 of SourceCodester’s Drag and
Drop Image Upload, as it could serve as a gateway for remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code, compromise data integrity, and potentially facilitate
broader network intrusions.
