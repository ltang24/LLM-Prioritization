CVE-2024-9926 pertains to a significant authorization flaw within the Jetpack
WordPress plugin, affecting versions from 3.9 up to 13.9, where the REST API
endpoint responsible for retrieving feedback data does not enforce proper access
controls, thereby allowing any authenticated user, including those with minimal
privileges such as subscribers, to read sensitive feedback submissions sent via
the Jetpack Contact Form. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in a
misconfiguration or omission in the authorization logic of the REST endpoint,
which fails to verify whether the requesting user possesses the necessary
permissions to access feedback data, effectively bypassing role-based access
controls. Exploitation involves an attacker who has a valid login credential for
a WordPress site with the Jetpack plugin installed; once authenticated, the
attacker can craft a straightforward API request to the feedback endpoint, which
responds with all stored feedback entries, including potentially sensitive PII
or confidential user communications. The attack vector is primarily remote,
leveraging standard HTTP(S) requests over the internet, and the exploitation
complexity is low, as no special conditions or environmental factors are
required; the attacker simply needs to be logged in with a low-privilege account
and issue a direct API call, making the attack highly accessible and reliable.
In real-world scenarios, this vulnerability could be exploited by malicious
actors who compromise or create low-privilege user accounts on targeted
WordPress sites, then extract private feedback data to facilitate social
engineering, data theft, or further attacks. For instance, a malicious
subscriber could harvest confidential customer inquiries or internal
communications, which could then be used for targeted phishing campaigns or
corporate espionage. Mitigation involves promptly updating the Jetpack plugin to
versions where the authorization checks on the feedback REST endpoint are
correctly enforced, or applying custom access control measures via server-side
modifications or plugin patches to restrict feedback data access solely to
authorized roles such as administrators. Additionally, disabling or limiting
access to the affected REST endpoints until patches are deployed can reduce
immediate risk. Site administrators should also review user roles and
permissions, enforce strong authentication mechanisms, and monitor API activity
logs for unusual access patterns. Given the detailed analysis of the
vulnerabilityâ€™s root cause, exploitation mechanism, and the available mitigation
strategies, the confidence level in this threat intelligence is high, supported
by the official CVE publication, the associated technical details, and the
corroborating evidence from reputable vulnerability databases. The overall risk
posed by CVE-2024-9926 is moderate, primarily due to its potential to expose
sensitive user data without affecting system integrity or availability, but it
remains a serious privacy concern for affected sites, especially those handling
confidential feedback or PII.
