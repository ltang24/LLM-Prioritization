CVE-2024-9963 pertains to a security vulnerability in Google Chrome prior to
version 130.0.6723.58, where insufficient data validation within the Downloads
component enables a remote attacker to perform UI spoofing attacks by convincing
users to engage in specific UI gestures on a crafted HTML page. The root cause
stems from inadequate input validation and sanitization when rendering or
interacting with download-related UI elements, allowing malicious actors to
manipulate the browser’s user interface to display deceptive content that mimics
legitimate download prompts or interfaces. Exploitation hinges on the attacker
delivering a malicious HTML page—via phishing emails, malicious links, or
compromised websites—that, when accessed by an unsuspecting user, prompts them
to perform specific gestures such as clicking, dragging, or interacting with
spoofed UI elements. These gestures, combined with the crafted content, enable
the attacker to deceive the user into believing they are interacting with
authentic download prompts, potentially leading to credential theft, malware
installation, or other social engineering outcomes. The attack vector is
network-based, relying on the delivery of malicious content over the internet,
and the complexity is high because it requires precise crafting of the HTML and
user cooperation, with no privileges required on the victim’s system, making it
accessible to any attacker capable of delivering malicious content. The attack’s
scope is confined within the browser’s UI, with no direct impact on system or
network resources, but the potential for user deception introduces significant
trust and integrity concerns. In real-world scenarios, this vulnerability could
be exploited via phishing campaigns that lure users into clicking on malicious
links embedded in emails or on compromised websites, where the attacker’s
crafted HTML page triggers the UI spoofing, leading users to unwittingly
disclose sensitive information or execute malicious downloads. To mitigate this
vulnerability, users should ensure they operate on the latest version of Chrome
where the fix is implemented, and organizations should enforce automatic updates
and deploy security policies that restrict the execution of untrusted scripts or
HTML content from unverified sources. Additionally, user education on
recognizing phishing attempts and suspicious UI prompts can reduce exploitation
risk. Disabling or restricting the execution of scripts in untrusted web content
and employing browser security extensions or policies that enforce strict
content validation can further mitigate potential abuse. Given the detailed
analysis and the official patch release, confidence in this threat intelligence
is high, supported by the technical root cause, the documented exploitation
mechanism, and the confirmed fix in the latest Chrome release, ensuring that the
assessment accurately reflects the current threat landscape associated with
CVE-2024-9963.
