The vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-9903 is a critical flaw affecting
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 of 07FLYCMS, 07FLY-CMS, and 07FlyCRM, which are
content management and customer relationship management platforms. The issue
resides in the `fileUpload` function of the `/admin/File/fileUpload` endpoint,
where insufficient validation of the `file` parameter allows attackers to upload
arbitrary files without restriction. This flaw stems from the absence of proper
input sanitization and file type validation, enabling malicious actors to upload
executable files, such as web shells, directly to the server. The exploitation
mechanism is straightforward, requiring only a crafted HTTP POST request
containing a malicious payload disguised as a legitimate file. Once uploaded,
the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the same privileges
as the web application, potentially leading to full system compromise. The
vulnerability is remotely exploitable, does not require authentication, and
involves minimal attack complexity, making it highly accessible to threat actors
with basic technical skills. The risk assessment indicates severe implications
for confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as successful exploitation
could allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data, modify or delete critical
files, and disrupt services. Real-world exploitation scenarios include attackers
deploying web shells to establish persistent backdoors, launching ransomware
attacks by encrypting server data, or using the compromised server as a pivot
point for lateral movement within the network. Public disclosure of the exploit
code has significantly increased the likelihood of exploitation, especially
given the lack of a vendor response or patch availability. To mitigate this
vulnerability, organizations using the affected products should immediately
implement a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious file upload
attempts, restrict access to the `/admin/File/fileUpload` endpoint using IP
whitelisting, and monitor server logs for unusual file upload activity.
Additionally, administrators should manually review and remove any unauthorized
files from the server and consider upgrading to a secure alternative platform if
no patch is forthcoming. While the vendor could not be contacted due to an
invalid email address, the public availability of exploit details and the
simplicity of the attack vector strongly suggest that exploitation is already
occurring in the wild. Based on the available evidence and the critical nature
of the vulnerability, there is high confidence in the accuracy of this
assessment, though the lack of vendor confirmation introduces some uncertainty
regarding potential mitigations or future updates.
