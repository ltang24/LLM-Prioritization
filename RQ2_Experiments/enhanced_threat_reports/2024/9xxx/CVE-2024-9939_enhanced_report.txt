CVE-2024-9939 pertains to a critical path traversal vulnerability affecting all
versions of the WordPress File Upload plugin up to and including 4.24.13,
specifically exploitable via the wfu_file_downloader.php script. This flaw
arises from improper validation of user-supplied input in the file download
functionality, allowing unauthenticated attackers to craft requests that
manipulate file paths with traversal sequences such as "../" to access files
outside the designated directory. The root cause stems from inadequate
sanitization and validation of file path parameters, which enables attackers to
bypass directory restrictions and read arbitrary files on the server, including
sensitive configuration files like wp-config.php or other private data
repositories. Exploitation is straightforward: an attacker sends a specially
crafted HTTP request targeting the vulnerable script, exploiting the absence of
strict input validation, with no need for authentication or user interaction,
making the attack highly accessible and automated. The attack vector is remote
over the network, leveraging the web server’s exposure to the internet, with
attack complexity rated low due to the simplicity of crafting malicious requests
that include traversal sequences. Since no privileges are required and no user
interaction is necessary, the attack can be executed by any unauthenticated
actor from any location, significantly broadening the threat surface. The impact
on confidentiality is high, as the attacker can access sensitive files outside
the intended scope, potentially leading to information disclosure that could
facilitate further attacks or data exfiltration. The scope of the vulnerability
remains confined within the plugin’s operational boundary, affecting the web
server process but not extending to other system components, thus the scope is
considered unchanged. The integrity and availability of the system are
unaffected, as the vulnerability only permits reading files without modification
or denial of service. In real-world scenarios, threat actors could exploit this
flaw to exfiltrate sensitive data from compromised WordPress sites, especially
those hosting critical configurations or private information, or to gather
intelligence for subsequent targeted attacks. Mitigation involves applying the
latest plugin updates that address the input validation flaw, implementing
strict server-side validation of all user inputs, and restricting file access
permissions to limit the potential damage. Web application firewalls and
intrusion detection systems can be configured to detect and block suspicious
traversal attempts. Additionally, disabling or removing the vulnerable plugin
until patched is advisable. Given the publicly available exploit vectors, the
widespread deployment of the plugin, and the straightforward nature of the
attack, confidence in this intelligence is high, supported by multiple
authoritative sources and detailed technical analysis. Overall, CVE-2024-9939
represents a significant risk to affected WordPress sites, emphasizing the
importance of prompt patching and robust input validation to prevent
unauthorized file disclosures.
