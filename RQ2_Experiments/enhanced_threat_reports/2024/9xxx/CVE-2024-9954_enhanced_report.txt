CVE-2024-9954 is a high-severity use-after-free vulnerability affecting Google
Chrome versions prior to 130.0.6723.58, which resides within the browser's
rendering engine, specifically in the AI or related components responsible for
processing web content. The root cause stems from improper management of memory
references during dynamic HTML content rendering, where the browser fails to
correctly free or reallocate heap memory after use, leading to dangling pointers
that can be dereferenced or overwritten. An attacker can craft a malicious HTML
page that, when loaded by a victim, triggers the use-after-free condition by
manipulating DOM elements or scripting constructs to induce heap corruption.
This exploitation mechanism involves precise control over the structure and
content of the HTML, exploiting the browser's internal handling of complex or
malformed DOM trees, especially in scenarios involving JavaScript execution or
multimedia processing. The attacker’s payload, delivered via a remote network
vector—such as maliciously hosted websites, email links, or embedded
ads—requires the victim to visit or interact with the crafted page, making the
attack vector network-based and relatively straightforward to deploy. The
exploitation complexity is low, as it hinges on the attacker’s ability to
engineer the HTML content to reliably trigger the flaw without requiring
advanced environmental conditions; however, success depends on the attacker’s
understanding of the browser’s internal memory management and rendering
processes. Privileges are not required beyond the ability to deliver and have
the victim load the malicious page, and user interaction is necessary, as the
victim must actively visit or open the malicious content, making social
engineering or phishing tactics effective delivery methods. The scope remains
confined to the browser process, but due to the potential for heap corruption,
the impact can extend to other processes or system stability if exploited for
code execution. CVSS assessments indicate a high risk, with the vulnerability
potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or system
crashes, thereby affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability
simultaneously. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read residual
memory contents, modify browser data, or cause denial of service, with the
primary impact being system instability or complete browser failure. Real-world
scenarios include malicious websites designed to exploit this flaw during
routine browsing, targeted phishing campaigns embedding malicious links in
emails, or compromised ad networks serving crafted HTML content to unwitting
users. Mitigation involves promptly updating Chrome to the latest version
130.0.6723.58 or later, which contains the necessary patches to address the
use-after-free flaw by improving memory management and rendering safety.
Additional safeguards include enabling sandboxing features, deploying web
content filtering, and educating users to avoid visiting untrusted or suspicious
websites. Developers and administrators should also consider deploying runtime
protections such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution
Prevention (DEP) to mitigate potential exploitation attempts. Our confidence in
this intelligence is high, given the detailed vulnerability description,
official vendor advisories, and the technical root cause analysis aligned with
known use-after-free exploitation patterns in modern browsers. The comprehensive
understanding of the memory management flaw, combined with the explicit
exploitation pathway and mitigations provided by Google, supports a robust
assessment of the threat landscape and recommended response measures.
