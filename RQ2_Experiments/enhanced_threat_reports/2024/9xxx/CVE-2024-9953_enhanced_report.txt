CVE-2024-9953 is a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability affecting CERT VINCE
(Vulnerability Information and Coordination Environment) in all versions prior
to 3.0.8, stemming from insecure deserialization of user-supplied data within
the administrative interface. Specifically, an authenticated administrative user
can inject an arbitrary Python pickle object into another user’s profile data,
which, when later accessed by the system or the user, triggers a deserialization
process that can lead to application-level service disruption. The root cause
lies in the unsafe handling of serialized objects in user profile storage, where
the application fails to adequately sanitize or validate serialized input before
it is persisted and subsequently deserialized by the Django server. Although
Django includes built-in restrictions to prevent arbitrary code execution during
unpickling, these safeguards do not prevent malformed or malicious pickle
payloads from causing application instability or crashes during deserialization,
particularly when the object graph is intentionally crafted to consume excessive
resources or exploit logic flaws in the deserialization path. From a risk
assessment perspective, the vulnerability presents a moderate overall severity
due to its limited scope of impact and required privilege level. The attack is
remotely exploitable over a network interface, assuming the attacker has already
obtained administrative credentials, which significantly reduces the likelihood
of opportunistic exploitation but remains a concern in environments where
insider threats or credential compromise are plausible. The attack complexity is
low, as it requires no special conditions beyond access to the administrative
interface and the ability to craft a malicious pickle payload. No user
interaction is required from the victim; the DoS condition is triggered
automatically when the profile is accessed, either by the user or by backend
processes, leading to potential service degradation or unavailability. While the
vulnerability does not compromise confidentiality or integrity, the impact on
availability is significant, particularly in multi-user environments where a
single corrupted profile could disrupt workflows or require manual intervention
to restore service. In real-world scenarios, a malicious administrator—either
acting maliciously or under duress—could inject such payloads into multiple user
profiles, causing widespread disruption across the platform, especially in
coordinated vulnerability disclosure workflows where timely communication is
critical. Alternatively, an attacker who has compromised an admin account
through phishing or credential stuffing could leverage this flaw to degrade
VINCE’s operational capabilities during an active vulnerability coordination
effort. To mitigate this issue, organizations should upgrade to VINCE version
3.0.8 or later, which includes patches that prevent arbitrary pickle injection
by sanitizing inputs and possibly replacing pickle-based storage with safer
serialization mechanisms such as JSON. In environments where immediate patching
is not feasible, administrators should restrict access to the administrative
interface, monitor for anomalous profile modifications, and consider
implementing application-layer input validation to block serialized object
patterns. Additionally, regular auditing of administrative accounts and
enforcing strong authentication mechanisms can reduce the risk of unauthorized
access. Based on the available technical evidence, public disclosures, and
observed behavior of the application, the confidence in this threat intelligence
assessment is high. The vulnerability is well-defined, the exploitation path is
reproducible under documented conditions, and the mitigation guidance is aligned
with standard secure development practices.
