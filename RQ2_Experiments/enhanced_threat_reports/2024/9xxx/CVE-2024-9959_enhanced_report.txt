CVE-2024-9959 pertains to a use-after-free vulnerability in the DevTools
component of Google Chrome versions prior to 130.0.6723.58, which allows remote
attackers who have already compromised the renderer process to potentially
exploit heap corruption through a crafted Chrome Extension. The root cause stems
from improper memory management within DevTools, where freed memory is not
correctly nullified or protected, enabling an attacker to trigger use-after-free
conditions by manipulating DOM elements or internal objects via malicious
extensions. Exploitation hinges on the attacker delivering a specially crafted
extension that, once installed and enabled by the user, interacts with the
renderer process to cause heap corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code
execution, data leakage, or browser crashes. The attack vector is remote,
relying on network delivery of malicious extensions, and the exploitation
complexity is low, as it requires no advanced conditions beyond crafting the
malicious extension and convincing the user to install it. Privileges required
are low, since the attacker must have the ability to run code within the
renderer process—typically achieved through extension installation—without
needing elevated system privileges. User interaction is mandatory, as the victim
must install or enable the malicious extension for the exploit to succeed. The
scope of the vulnerability is confined within the renderer process, with no
explicit indication of cross-process escalation, thus the scope remains
unchanged. The impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability is high,
given the potential for arbitrary code execution, data access or modification,
and browser instability or crashes, respectively. In real-world scenarios,
attackers could leverage this vulnerability by distributing malicious extensions
via social engineering or compromised extension stores, targeting unsuspecting
users to gain persistent control over the affected browser environment,
exfiltrate sensitive data, or disrupt service. Mitigation involves promptly
updating Chrome to the latest version (130.0.6723.58 or later), which patches
the use-after-free flaw, and implementing extension security best practices such
as scrutinizing extension sources and permissions. Users should be cautious
about installing extensions from untrusted sources and enable browser security
features like sandboxing and extension permissions management. Given the
technical details and the nature of the exploit, confidence in this intelligence
is high, supported by official Chrome security advisories, detailed root cause
analysis, and the consistency of the vulnerability description with known
use-after-free exploitation patterns in modern browsers.
