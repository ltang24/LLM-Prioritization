CVE-2024-9916 is a critical vulnerability identified in HuangDou UTCMS V9,
specifically within the file app/modules/ut-cac/admin/cli.php. This
vulnerability arises from improper input validation, allowing for OS command
injection via the manipulation of the 'o' argument. The root cause of this issue
is the failure to sanitize user input, which permits attackers to inject
arbitrary operating system commands that the application executes with the
privileges of the web server process. The exploitation mechanism involves
crafting a specially constructed HTTP request that includes malicious payloads
in the 'o' parameter, which the vulnerable script then processes, leading to
unauthorized command execution. This vulnerability is particularly severe due to
its remote exploitability, allowing attackers to execute commands without prior
authentication or local access, significantly increasing the attack surface. The
complexity of the attack is low, as it requires minimal technical skill to
exploit, given that the exploit has been publicly disclosed and is readily
available. The potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability
is substantial, as successful exploitation could lead to complete system
compromise, data exfiltration, or service disruption. In real-world scenarios,
attackers could leverage this vulnerability to gain initial access to a network,
establish persistence, and escalate privileges, potentially using it as a
foothold for further attacks within an enterprise environment. Mitigation
involves applying strict input validation and output encoding to prevent command
injection, as well as implementing a web application firewall (WAF) to detect
and block malicious requests. Additionally, organizations should ensure that
their systems are regularly updated and patched, although the vendor's lack of
response to the disclosure necessitates that users of UTCMS V9 implement these
mitigations independently. It is also advisable to monitor network traffic for
unusual activity that may indicate exploitation attempts. Our confidence in this
intelligence is high, based on the availability of detailed exploit information
and the corroboration of multiple independent sources confirming the
vulnerability's existence and exploitation potential.
