CVE-2024-9905 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability affecting version 1.0 of
the SourceCodester Online Eyewear Shop application, specifically impacting the
administrative inventory viewing functionality accessible via the URL parameter
/admin/?page=inventory/view_inventory&id=2. The root cause of this vulnerability
stems from improper input validation and sanitization of the 'id' parameter
within the server-side code responsible for processing database queries. This
flaw allows an attacker to manipulate the 'id' argument, injecting malicious SQL
payloads that are directly concatenated into the underlying database query
without adequate parameterization or escaping, thereby enabling arbitrary SQL
code execution. Exploitation involves crafting a specially designed URL
containing malicious SQL syntax in the 'id' parameter, which, when processed by
the server, causes the database to execute unintended commands, potentially
exposing sensitive data, modifying records, or even gaining administrative
control. The attack vector is remote, requiring only standard HTTP requests, and
the complexity is low, as it does not necessitate authentication or advanced
techniques, making it accessible to a broad range of threat actors. In
real-world scenarios, this vulnerability could be exploited by malicious actors
to extract customer data, manipulate inventory records, or escalate privileges
within the application, especially if administrative credentials are stored or
accessible via the compromised database. Attackers might leverage this flaw for
data theft, competitive espionage, or to establish persistent footholds within
the target environment. Mitigation involves immediate application of security
patches that enforce rigorous input validation, parameterized queries, and
prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, alongside comprehensive code
reviews and security testing of all user-input handling routines. Deploying web
application firewalls with SQL injection detection capabilities can provide an
additional layer of defense, as well as disabling or restricting direct access
to administrative functions where feasible. Regular database activity monitoring
and anomaly detection can help identify ongoing exploitation attempts. Given the
public disclosure of the exploit and the straightforward nature of the
vulnerability, confidence in this intelligence is high, supported by the
detailed technical root cause analysis and multiple reference sources confirming
the issue. Overall, organizations using the affected version should prioritize
immediate remediation to prevent potential data breaches or operational
disruptions, and ensure ongoing security best practices are enforced to mitigate
similar vulnerabilities in future releases.
