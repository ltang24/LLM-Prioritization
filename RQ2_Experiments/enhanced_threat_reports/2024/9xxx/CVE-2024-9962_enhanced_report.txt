CVE-2024-9962 pertains to a security flaw in Google Chrome versions prior to
130.0.6723.58, arising from an inappropriate implementation within the browser's
permissions handling mechanism. This flaw enables a remote attacker to induce UI
spoofing through a crafted HTML page, exploiting the browser's rendering and
permission management logic to deceive users into perceiving malicious UI
elements as legitimate. The root cause stems from a misconfigured or
insufficiently restrictive permissions model that fails to adequately validate
or sandbox UI components, allowing crafted web content to manipulate the visual
interface when specific user interactions, such as gestures or clicks, are
performed. Exploitation hinges on convincing the victim to visit a malicious web
page and perform targeted UI gestures, which act as triggers for the underlying
permission misimplementation, thus enabling the attacker to overlay or mimic
genuine UI elements. The attack vector is remote, delivered via web links or
embedded content, with a high attack complexity due to the necessity of precise
user actions; the attacker cannot force gestures but must rely on social
engineering to persuade the user to perform specific interactions. Privileges
are not required on the attackerâ€™s part, as the attack leverages user
interaction within the browser context, and the scope remains confined to the
browser's UI layer, affecting only the local environment without extending to
other system components. The impact on confidentiality, integrity, and
availability is limited; the primary concern is UI deception, which could
facilitate social engineering or phishing attacks, but does not inherently lead
to data disclosure, data modification, or service disruption. Real-world
exploitation scenarios might involve convincing users to click on malicious
links embedded in emails or websites, prompting them to perform gestures that
trigger the spoofing, thereby deceiving them into revealing sensitive
information or executing unintended actions. Mitigation involves promptly
updating Chrome to version 130.0.6723.58 or later, which addresses the
permission implementation flaw, and employing standard security practices such
as user education to recognize social engineering attempts. Additionally,
deploying web filtering, content security policies, and browser security
extensions can reduce the likelihood of encountering malicious pages. Given the
technical details and the nature of the vulnerability, confidence in this
intelligence is high, supported by official Chrome security advisories, detailed
root cause analysis, and the comprehensive CVSS metric assessment aligning with
the described exploitation mechanism and impact scope.
