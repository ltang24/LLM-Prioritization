CVE-2024-9984 pertains to a critical vulnerability in Ragic’s Enterprise Cloud
Database, affecting all versions, including the initial release, where the
system fails to enforce authentication for specific functionalities, notably
those that handle user session cookies. This flaw stems from a root cause
involving missing access controls on certain API endpoints or internal
functions, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to craft and send requests
that bypass normal security checks. Exploitation hinges on the attacker’s
ability to directly access these unprotected endpoints over the network,
leveraging the absence of authentication mechanisms, which makes the attack
straightforward and highly accessible. The attacker does not require any
privileges or prior user credentials, and user interaction is unnecessary,
enabling fully automated exploitation from any location with network
reachability to the vulnerable service. The attack's scope remains within the
application's security boundary, but the impact is severe, as it allows
attackers to retrieve any user's session cookie, which often contains sensitive
tokens or identifiers that facilitate session hijacking. Once obtained, these
cookies can be used to impersonate legitimate users, including administrators,
leading to a complete compromise of confidentiality and integrity, with the
attacker able to perform any authorized actions under the hijacked session. The
impact on confidentiality and integrity is high because the attacker can access
or manipulate user data, perform administrative operations, or escalate
privileges, while the system's availability remains unaffected directly;
however, the consequences of session hijacking could indirectly lead to service
disruptions or degraded user trust. The exploitation process is uncomplicated,
requiring only the sending of a malicious request to the unprotected endpoint
without the need for user interaction or privileges, making it highly
exploitable over the network. Real-world scenarios include attackers scanning
for exposed endpoints, exploiting the flaw to harvest session cookies en masse,
and then using these cookies to access sensitive user accounts, perform
fraudulent transactions, or escalate privileges within the system. Mitigation
involves promptly deploying patches or configuration changes to enforce
authentication on all sensitive functionalities, implementing strict access
controls, and monitoring for abnormal request patterns targeting the vulnerable
endpoints. Additionally, deploying session management best practices such as
short-lived cookies, secure flags, and multi-factor authentication can reduce
the risk of session hijacking. Given the detailed technical analysis, the
clarity of the root cause, and the publicly available references, confidence in
this threat intelligence is high, supported by official advisories and technical
assessments that confirm the exploitability and severity of this vulnerability.
