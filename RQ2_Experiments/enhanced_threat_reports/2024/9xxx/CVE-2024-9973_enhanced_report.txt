The vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-9973 affects version 1.0 of the
SourceCodester Online Eyewear Shop, specifically targeting an insecure input
handling flaw within the /admin/?page=reports component, which is responsible
for report viewing functionalities. This flaw stems from improper sanitization
of user-supplied input in the 'date' argument parameter, allowing an attacker to
craft malicious SQL statements that are directly embedded into backend database
queries. The root cause lies in the application's failure to validate or
parameterize the input, enabling an attacker to manipulate the SQL query
structure, leading to a classic SQL injection attack vector. Exploitation
involves sending a specially crafted HTTP request with malicious SQL payloads
embedded in the 'date' parameter, which the server executes without proper
validation, resulting in arbitrary SQL command execution. This can lead to
unauthorized data retrieval, modification, or deletion, and potentially escalate
to remote code execution if the attacker leverages database vulnerabilities or
extracts sensitive credentials. The vulnerability's critical classification
reflects its high impact potential, especially since it can be exploited
remotely over the network with minimal authentication requirements, and the
attack complexity is low due to the straightforward nature of the injection,
making it accessible to a broad threat actor spectrum. In real-world scenarios,
malicious actors could exploit this flaw to exfiltrate customer data, manipulate
sales records, or compromise administrative access, especially if the database
contains sensitive personal or financial information. Attackers might also
deploy automated tools to scan for similar vulnerabilities across other
instances of the product or related platforms. Mitigation involves immediate
application of patches or updates from the vendor that implement parameterized
queries or input validation to prevent malicious SQL code execution. Developers
should review and sanitize all user inputs rigorously, employ prepared
statements, and restrict database permissions to minimize damage if exploitation
occurs. Network-level controls such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) can also
help detect and block malicious payloads targeting this vulnerability. Given
that the exploit has been publicly disclosed and the attack vector is
straightforward, the risk level is high, emphasizing the need for prompt
remediation. Confidence in this intelligence is high, supported by the detailed
vulnerability description, public disclosure, and available exploit references,
which collectively confirm the technical root cause and exploitation mechanism,
although the specific impact scope may vary depending on the deployment
environment and database configuration.
