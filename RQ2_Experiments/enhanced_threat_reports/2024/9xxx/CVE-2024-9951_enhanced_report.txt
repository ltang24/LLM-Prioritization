CVE-2024-9951 pertains to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
affecting all versions of the WP Photo Album Plus plugin for WordPress up to and
including 8.8.05.003, stemming from inadequate input sanitization and output
escaping of the 'wppa-tab' URL parameter. This flaw allows unauthenticated
attackers to craft malicious URLs embedding arbitrary JavaScript code within the
'wppa-tab' parameter, which, when a victim clicks the link, is reflected back
and executed in the context of the victim’s browser. The root cause lies in the
plugin’s failure to properly neutralize user-supplied input before rendering it
in web pages, enabling malicious scripts to bypass security controls and execute
within the page’s DOM. Exploitation hinges on the attacker delivering a
specially crafted URL containing embedded script payloads via email, social
media, or other channels, with the victim’s browser executing the malicious code
upon visiting the link. The attack vector is remote and network-based, with low
complexity, as no additional environmental conditions or privileges are
required; the attacker simply needs to generate a malicious link and persuade a
user to click it. The attack requires user interaction, classifying it as a
reflected XSS, with the scope confined to the affected plugin and the specific
web page context, without crossing trust boundaries or affecting other system
components. The potential impacts include theft of session cookies or sensitive
data stored in the browser, manipulation of displayed content, or execution of
malicious scripts that could deceive or hijack user sessions, though the core
system and server data remain unaffected. The exploitation does not impact
system availability, as it does not cause crashes or resource exhaustion, but it
can degrade user experience or facilitate further social engineering attacks.
The CVSS assessment indicates a high likelihood of remote exploitation with low
complexity, no privileges required, and user interaction necessary, resulting in
a moderate overall risk profile characterized by a CVSS-like descriptive score
emphasizing the ease of remote exploitation, the need for user action, and
limited impact on confidentiality and integrity. Mitigation involves promptly
updating the plugin to a version where input sanitization and output escaping
are properly implemented, or applying web application firewall rules to filter
malicious payloads in the 'wppa-tab' parameter. Additionally, website
administrators should review and harden their security posture by implementing
Content Security Policies (CSP), enabling input validation, and educating users
about the risks of clicking untrusted links. Given the widespread deployment of
the plugin across numerous WordPress sites and the straightforward nature of the
exploit, confidence in this intelligence is high, supported by official
vulnerability disclosures, detailed technical analyses, and consistent evidence
from reputable security sources. The combination of the vulnerability’s
technical root cause, the ease of remote exploitation, and the potential for
social engineering attacks underscores the importance of timely remediation to
prevent exploitation and mitigate associated risks.
