CVE-2024-9988 is an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting all versions
up to and including 2.15 of the Crypto Tool plugin for WordPress, developed by
odude. The flaw resides in the `crypto_connect_ajax_process::register` function,
which fails to validate the authenticity of the user parameter supplied during
the AJAX registration process. This oversight allows unauthenticated remote
attackers to impersonate any existing user, including administrators, provided
they know or can guess the target username. The root cause lies in the absence
of proper server-side validation and authentication checks within the AJAX
handler, which processes user registration and login logic without verifying
session state or cryptographic tokens. Exploitation is trivial and requires only
that the attacker craft a specific HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint,
supplying a known username to gain unauthorized access. The attack can be
executed remotely over the network without any prior privileges or user
interaction, and it does not depend on any environmental conditions or complex
configurations, making it highly accessible to threat actors. The vulnerability
results in a scope change, as it enables attackers to escalate privileges and
compromise the broader WordPress environment beyond the plugin itself. The
impact is severe across all security dimensions: confidentiality is compromised
as attackers gain access to sensitive user data and administrative interfaces;
integrity is undermined through potential content tampering, plugin or theme
modifications, and malicious configuration changes; and availability is at risk
if attackers disable services, delete content, or introduce denial-of-service
conditions through administrative controls. In real-world scenarios, this
vulnerability could be exploited in automated campaigns targeting WordPress
sites, where attackers use credential stuffing or enumeration techniques to
identify valid usernames and then leverage the flaw to hijack accounts, deface
websites, install malware, or exfiltrate data. Given the low complexity and high
impact, this vulnerability poses a critical risk to any unpatched deployment.
Immediate mitigation involves updating the Crypto Tool plugin to a version that
includes proper authentication checks in the AJAX registration handler. Site
administrators should also monitor logs for suspicious login activity, enforce
strong username policies to reduce predictability, and consider implementing Web
Application Firewall (WAF) rules to block unauthorized access attempts to the
vulnerable endpoint. Disabling the plugin until a patch is applied may be
warranted in high-risk environments. Based on the available technical evidence
and corroborated analysis from reputable sources, the confidence in this
assessment is high.
